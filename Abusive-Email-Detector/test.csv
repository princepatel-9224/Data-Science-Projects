Subject:	October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

hey mike , how are you.
I should be getting a ""day/date"" from Earl as to when to give the Forest 
Service the date(s) for them to schedule their tree cutting.
Ken Jacobs has asked me (TW) for a date/week.  The forest service will then 
set up a crew and send them in.  Once the trees are cut, Ken will send me the 
Tree Contract and invoice for those trees.

I mentioned this to Donna Marten and Earl in last weeks conference call.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

excelr arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
excelr has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  excelr has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

excelr in the Middle East 
excelr has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
excelr has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows excelr to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although excelr had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through excelrOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

excelr was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for excelr as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

40,"TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected
FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the excelr Wholesale Services organization was created and 
announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale 
companies (excelr Americas, excelr Europe, excelr Global Markets and excelr 
Industrial Markets) plus excelr Net Works and excelr Global Assets were 
included in the excelr Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational 
memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was 
moved into excelr Net Works to align our operational services, information 
technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality 
services to excelr wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to 
evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as 
well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations 
teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we 
wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under excelr Net Works.  Senior 
management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to 
excelr Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks 
did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and 
non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately 
report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred 
to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting 
April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping 
purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' 
structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to excelr Net 
Works. Because you are transferring between excelr payroll companies, IRS 
requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only 
to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 
for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does 
not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you 
on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden 
of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by 
filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the 
withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your 
tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  
You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with 
any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you 
and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best 
practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, 
please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as 
identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is 
dedicated:

There is several deliverables to the organization before the end of year to help with monitoring and consistency of projects across ENA/EGM/EIM.

The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the request 
of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Subject:	excelr EFS issues

Thanks for taking the time to put this PowerPoint presentation together to
better outline the flow. It helps us discuss it internally.

Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"".
Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (excelr) FCM will
accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?
There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to
issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.

They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between
Campbell, excelr, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this
the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the
specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If
we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance
of the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
CDY

EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS INFO AND TAKE STEPS TO SHOW DISGUST WITH THE ABSENSE OF THOUGHTFULNESS. MIKE 

FYI 

CNN Headline News did a short news listing regarding Ford and GM's 
(and other major carmakers) contributions to the relief and recovery 
efforts in New York and Washington. The findings are as follows...... 

1. Ford- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number plus 10 Excursions to NY Fire Dept. The company also 
offered ER response team services and office space to displaced 
government employees. 

2. GM- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number and a fleet of vans, suv's, and trucks. 

3. Daimler Chrysler- $10 million to support of the children and victims of 
the Sept. 11 attack. 

4. Harley Davidson motorcycles- $1 million and 30 new motorcycles to the 
New York Police Dept. 

5. Volkswagen- Employees and management created a Sept 11 Foundation, 
funded initial with $2 million, for the assistance of the children and 
victims of the WTC. 

6. Hyundai- $300,000 to the American Red Cross. 

7. Audi- Nothing. 

8. BMW- Nothing. 

9. Daewoo- Nothing. 

10. Fiat- Nothing. 

11. Honda- Nothing despite boasting of second best sales month ever in 
August 2001 

12. Isuzu- Nothing. 

13. Mitsubishi- Nothing. 

14. Nissan- Nothing. 

15. Porsche- Nothing. Press release with condolences via the Porsche 
website. 

16. Subaru- Nothing. 

17. Suzuki- Nothing. 

18. Toyota- Nothing despite claims of high sales in July and August 2001. 
Condolences posted on the website 

Whenever the time may be for you to purchase or lease a new vehicle, keep 
this information in mind. You might want to give more consideration to a 
car manufactured by an American-owned and / or American based company. 
Apart from Hyundai and Vo! lkswagen, the foreign car companies contributed 
nothing at all to the citizens of the United States. It's OK for these 
companies 
to take money out of this country, but it is apparently not acceptable to 
return 
some in a time of crisis. I believe we should not forget things like this.

67,"FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit on 
the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission 
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the ""expected range 
of operating conditions"".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would 
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100 
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately 
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

through excelr stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=

to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

excelr stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

and a contributing factor to your performance and to excelr=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the excelr Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the excelr Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (excelrOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20

on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by excelr=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? excelrOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20

December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about excelrOptions =

Objective
excelr is sizing up the opportunity to offer internal back office processing=
=20
services to external clients. Objective of this meeting was to understand t=
he=20
spreadsheet meant to estimate the potential P&L for this offering.
Overview
Looked at spreadsheet for validation:
? Need to better determine the actual market for this service.
? Need to better understand the current revenue and expense projections and=
=20
assumptions, expanding on them to include customers not currently with Enro=
n.
Ongoing:
Defining the size of the market:
? There may be three =01+levels=01, of markets for these services - one for=
 energy=20
risk mgt. ops (attack first), a larger market if we include global market=
=20
offerings, and yet a larger market if we think of our offering as transacti=
on=20
processing, ala ADP.
? There are a number of ways to derive the potential market size.  The=20
current spreadsheet identifies existing customers.  Some may be seeking our=
=20
services based on their current and projected deal volumes. =20
? Fred will continue to analyze the market size(s), adding customers outsid=
e=20
of current EOL spectrum.
? Fred will analyze the offerings and pricing structures used by competitor=
s.=20
? Sheri will get with internal data owners to (in)validate current=20
spreadsheet numbers and identify customers with high year-over-year increas=
es=20
in EOL transaction volume.

Expenses
? James will take a harder look at the expenses.  We wonder if number of=20
transactions is the best method to use.  What is the real cost driver?  Whe=
re=20
are the =01+breaking points=01,, or transaction levels where we must invest=
 further=20
to offer services to additional customers?

Strategy
? Beth Apollo will schedule a meeting with Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Rahil, =
et=20
al to discuss ongoing big picture.
? Beth will also schedule a meeting with Mark Taylor, to include Rahil and=
=20
Dale.  They will discuss points on the service level agreement that we will=
=20
use with our external customers.

81,"Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of excelr Field 
and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for 
your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I 
was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not 
bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to 
make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, 
and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure 
that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as 
well.  

I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see 
at the end of January.  --Sally ",Non Abusive

Subject: Chili Taster


Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was
visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous
celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one
else
wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last
moment,
and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking
directions
to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two
judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and
besides
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to
put the
               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
                        seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
people
               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on
my face.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by
now.
               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the

               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
with fresh refills;
               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like
this nuclear-waste
               I'm eating.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
                       considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
contestant
               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given
me brain
               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring
beer directly
               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the
other judges asked
               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice

                       and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
                        Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
sulfuric
               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except
big Sally.
               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
chili
                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
am worried
                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit
of distress
                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't

                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and
the world sounds
                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered
with chili which
                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of
lava-like stuff to
                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll
know what
                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too
painful. Screw it, I'm
                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just
suck it in through
                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
not too bold
                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.
JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
hot. Sorry
                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge
Number 3 passed out,
                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.
Not sure if he's going
                        to make it. Poor Yank.

Phillip,

I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc=
ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=
rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to=
 get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=
t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=
ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=
ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.

I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=
d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =
is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=
1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=
nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top=
 of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=
how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=
r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =
and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=
bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a=
 greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=
ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=
ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=
en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=
ts each change will have on your equity and return.

We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have=
 had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =
overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=
ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=

us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.

ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.

Event  Profile	

In this painstaking depiction of  Pittsburgh in the `70s, Wilson exposes the nobility and corruption of the human  spirit ravaged by racism, poverty, death, longing, even alcoholism. Five men  working for a car service struggle to realize their (sometimes unformed) dreams  and stumble upon revolutionary ire along the way. 
While the central  conflict rests between the cab station's owner and his ex-convict son, Wilson's  egalitarian spirit ensures that every character has his piece to say.
Hip  but pointed dialogue alternates with soul-bearing and comic monologues. Whatever  the tone, these soliloquies are seized with gusto.

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of excelr's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of excelr's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at excelr 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to excelr in which he has had overviews 
of excelr's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience excelr tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) excelr is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with excelr

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.

With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!

Now, the Moral of the Story:
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less.

P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.

Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.",Abusive

Gentlemen:

	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance
Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics
(and any others which occur to you):

1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified
therein) established;

2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;

3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the
wholesale gas and electricity business.

	It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of
recent investments and perhaps on the larger ""asset"" investments such as
Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.  Even as we move away from these investments,
there may be some additional lessons to be learned.  Does our post-audit
process and procedure continue?

	We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the
proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

	Best regards.

Sally and Brian,
Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned 
over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of 
records to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We 
will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the 
transition of personnel from excelr to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of 
the HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three 
to ten individuals.

Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or 
concerns.

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Pinot Grigio is clean, crisp and refreshing.

The 1999 Pinot Grigio has a clear, straw color and a pleasant nose with delicate aromas of apricot and tropical fruit. This wine is refreshing and crisp with a light to medium body that will allow it to pair well with dishes of all types.

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Merlot clearly attests to the rising notoriety of Merlot in general, and Italian Merlot in particular, by offering a full flavored style without the more astringent tannins found in Cabernet Sauvignon. Ruby red in color, with aromas of currants and cherries, Bella Sera Merlot offers supple plum and blackberry flavors on the palate, and a ripe, rich finish. The vibrant fruit flavors and good acidity of this Merlot make it an excellent match with a wide range of foods, including tomato-based pasta dishes, grilled meats and poultry.</P></span>

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with excelr, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

Kenny and all:

Here is an update regarding where we stand with Rogas biological resources
permitting:

FESA 10a(1)B: U.S.F.W.S. has mailed the letter to Kern Water Bank Authority
authorizing KWBA to sell credits to EOTT and permitting EOTT to be a
""covered"" third party under KWBA's 10a(1)B permit; however, KWBA has not
yet
received the letter. When KWBA receives the letter, they will be able to
authorize the project as soon as they receive the check from EOTT for
compensation credits (I do not know if your right-of-way agreements and
encroachment permits are complete) and mitigation measures are implemented
(preactivity surveys, trapping).

CESA 2081 MOU: EOTT has notified CDFG that the project will commence and
who
the project rep is; CDFG has verbally concurred regarding our proposed
avoidance measures (including trapping) for Tipton kangaroo rats and
blunt-nosed leopard lizard; the project may commence on Coles Levee
Ecosystem
Preserve as soon as we implement the biological resource mitigation
measures
(preactivity survey - submitted to AERA; trapping; etc.) and the Letter of
Credit (or equivalent) is submitted to CDFG for compensation acres.

Bypass Channel: West Coast Environmental was supposed to have submitted
Streambed Alteration Notification and Clean Water Act (Army Corps)
notification within the last couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

Sally:? Hope all is well in London, it could not be more  ""soupy"", rainy or 
overcast than it has been here.? Sunday is shaping  up...Nancy at Elegant 
Accessories by Nancy has a presentation for us, but is  unable to give it due 
to market or show or something.? I will pick it up  from her and run through 
it on Sunday.? I am trying to get Debbie VanDyke  to do Habitat and the lady 
from Applause to come.? Have been working on  form for Nominations...The 
meeting is at Nancy Galante's house, I have spoken to  her about the girls 
listing favorite things from Sat. pm and she was (nicely)  opposed to that, 
as the girls really only get limited choices---oops.? She  did tell me, 
however, that three girls have already selected dresses...(are we  already 
behind?) and she will speak briefly on dresses and registration and ask  for 
questions.
At Mondays patroness meeting (which was pretty non-newsy), I  gave all Jr. 
moms a ""heads-up""? that March meeting would be at dress  shop,or bridal shop, 
and that they would be invited, just for scheduling  purposes.
?
I have spoken with Barb Lindsey..a NCL member whose husband is  with Houston 
Police Dept.? He is realitivly cool, as far as a dad police  combo, but does 
have girl and boy twins in college, so he knows  teen-agers.? He is willing 
to talk to girls about what to do in case of  accident, when to leave your 
car, safety and so on...thought we could tie that  in with car maintenance 
meeting.

I will let you know as the Sunday plans progress, I am afraid  that this is 
going to be a ""catch-all"".? Know you are busy, no need to  respond, call 
Friday pm or Saturday if you have questions.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my
coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"",
and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice."" There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?"" I tell him
(no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?"" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a
bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a ""Stupid cocksucker.""
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. ""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in."" We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
""Last call for alcohol!"" I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

157,"Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

160,"Every quarter or so, Data Systems & Solutions hosts seminars to educate
clients in the process industries on the value of integrated environmental,
health & safety management information systems (EMIS).  Our last seminar on
May 3, 2001 resulted in over 30 clients attending.  

We are planning two additional seminars this year (Integrating Process
Safety Management - October 11th) and (Integrated EH&S Solutions - November
6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For
instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a ""hot"" topic
right now.  Overall, the top three interests we are hearing from our
customers on the topic of EMIS include:

1. Sustainable Development ""Triple Bottom Line"" coupled with Key Performance
Metrics/Roll-Up Reporting
2. Integrating Information Systems with EMIS
3. Risk Reduction

The ever looming concern over cost justification has become much clearer and
will be addressed in future seminars.  Even today, there is no ""panacea"" for
EH&S software applications.  Most vendors address the ""E"" picture or the
""H&S"" picture, but do not cover both holistically.  With emerging
information technology protocols such as extensible markup language (XML) it
is now possible to get a true ""best of breed"" solution that will allow you
to ""plug and play"" modules instead of hoping for everything in one software
vendor.  Unfortunately, the EMIS software marketplace still remains
unconsolidated and there are inherent risks with selecting a software
vendor.  The goal of our one day seminar is to address all of these concerns
and to help our customers to understand what is involved in a typical EMIS
project...from an initial assessment of your needs, to determining the value
of an EMIS and the core reasons for doing it, to selecting systems where
gaps exist, to allocating proper resources to ensure a successful project,
to implementing the solution, to integrating with other facility information
systems, and maintenance and training.

Let us know if you or anyone from your organization are interested in
attending our seminar.  We want to give you the most value possible in our
one day educational forum.  Please let us know if there is anything in
particular that you would like to get information on that may not be covered
in the topics listed on the agenda.

When Tangie moved on to her new position she left Chris with $100.00 to have a birthday party for the dept. This is money she had left over from our group.  After discussing with a few other associates it was mentioned this money should be contributed to our fellow Americans that were struck in last Tuesday's attack in D.C. and  N.Y.  I think that's a great idea, maybe we could have a collection jar and add to the $100.00 and then have the company match before sending.  Is this okay with you Lynn & Shelley??

Thanks,

179,"Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Subject: Upcoming Compensation Analysis


To All Energy Operations Directors:

My name is Todd Burke and I'm a Compensation Specialist with ENA Human 
Resources (see attached bio).  As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all 
Energy Operations staff.  The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that 
the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive 
marketplace.  Each component of pay will be examined individually and within 
the context of excelr's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus, 
long-term incentives and total compensation).

The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in 
two stages:  

Stage 1-Data Gathering:  the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data 
around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you 
the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you 
perceive to exist.  

Stage 2-Job Matching:  the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we 
will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which 
positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and 
responsibilities of your staff.  We will not be able to match 100 percent of 
your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys.  Non-benchmark jobs 
will be reviewed using a job ""slotting"" approach.

To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts 
containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which 
I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting.  The intent 
here is to give you the opportunity to ""pre-match"" your respective jobs 
thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our 
Stage 2 meeting.  It will be critical that you are comfortable with the 
matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering 
relevant market data.  The data will only be as good as the matches.

Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data 
based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative 
analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck.

I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1 
interviews.  I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful 
completion of this project.

Please call with any questions or comments.  I can be reached at X39437.  

Kind Regards,

Todd Burke
ENA Compensation

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of excelr's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: ""Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.""

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until excelr closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany. 

excelr Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from excelr's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by excelr business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   excelr and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, excelr's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for excelr. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for excelr.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in excelr's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  ""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""  

While mischievous excelr employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

206,"Working on the New Power deal really gets one thinking about the liquidity provisions in contracts (collateral posting provisions).   Given the emphasis on the swings in net cash/credit posted at a excelr Corp level, perhaps we should think of metric to measure the posting risk.   Contracts have different thresholds (or none at all) and the effect on our credit capacity is not always symetrical.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA's network services.

1.	Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy.
a.	Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=EES, SOURCE=AEP, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2.	Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy.  
a.	Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=LAGN, POD=EES, SOURCE=(LAGN UNIT NAME), SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will be evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXIA) use POR=EES. 

3.	Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sepa is not flowing and we can bring MGW's in from the Tva border.
a.	Ex.  We find 11 MGW's  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources) on the Entergy OASIS, POR=TVA, POD=MDEA, SOURCE=LGE, SINK=MDEA, BID PRICE = $0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying (displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarify this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem.  I just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with Entergy Transmission.

217,"Thad,

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:

1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served:  ""sell with"" (each other); and ""sell through"" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a ""jumping off point"" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
""EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use"" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.

Subject: Burning Fat




Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the excelr building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the excelr Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?

that business does not have to be discussed and?I meant it.? As far as

it to be clear to you that the ""deal"" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited 
you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant 
messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.? 
However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with

hope I have done that.
???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical 
issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved 
over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an 
excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as 
the site was brought back up.

246,"Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush
Victory.""

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques
to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

I spoke with Greg Manako with Exelon last week when you were on vacation.  He had the following comments regarding the HR options you were hearing about in the market place:

	1.  They are not sure of their long term perspective.  Thus, they are focusing on structures that are three years and less.

	2.  They are interested in June-September only
	
	3.  They are flexible on the size of the transaction (100-500 MW?)

	4.  They want to buy a 10-11 HR and sell a 6-7 HR.  

	5.  They would like a financially settled transaction.
	
	6.  They would love hourly (virtual peaker) but would settle for daily.


Please let me know your level of interest.  I would like to get something back to them just to start discussions.

Subject: EcoElectrica/Corinto Valuations for Compensation Purposes

Rick,

The valuation ranges for EcoElectrica and Corrinto, as revised, are as 
follows:

EcoElectrica: High - $240.8 million (excludes FASB125 interest; terminal 
value discounted at 18%)

                         Low - $220.3 million (included $20.5 million of 
FASB125 interest as project cost)


Corinto:   High - $4.389 million (20% discount rate)

                   Low - $3.609 million (23.7% discount rate)

For EcoElectrica, the argument is whether the deal team should bear the cost 
of off-balance sheet treatment in choosing between the high and low values.  
For Corinto, the higher discount rate and lower value reflects how RAC would 
value this transaction as a new merchant deal, reflecting Nicaragua's 
downgrade; the lower discount rate is consistent with the original RAC 
discount rate and may be a reasonable discount rate for a completed plant to 
a strategic buyer.

Please let me know if you require additional information.  I am happy to 
speak with David Haug on these if you'd like.

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you

Please find the following EMail as a piece of the EBS / Compaq history.   
This is the amendment language developed to address the five clarification 
points rasied during the EBS / Compaq meetings in August and September 
2000.   These meetings were held to gain mutual understanding and clearly 
identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement.  

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning.   I look forward to resolution of these perspectives. 

thanks,

Thanks so much for your cooperation and rest  assured, we're endeavoring to

getting the index out after options  expire?

This will take some time, getting people to  cooperate, but we will prevail.

Also, please note we're collecting historicals for  ComEd, TVA and SPP, if 
you want to include those deals (no indicative necessary  at this time).

267,"most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.

not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing 
sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated 
the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and 
either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the 
data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and 
inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional 
money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts....

The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in 
August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that 
calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.
When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.
When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts, or do things my own way,
they call me a bitch.
Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I
live my life MY way. It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.
When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak up against it, I am
defined as a bitch.
The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being
everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish.
I am proud to be a bitch!  It means I have the courage and strength to
allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone
else's idea of what they
think I ""should"" be.  I am outspoken, opinionated, and determined.
By God, I want what I want, and there is nothing wrong with that!
So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame,
try to squash every ounce
of beauty I hold within me. You won't succeed. And if
that makes me a bitch, so be it.
I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.

287,"Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be interested.

289,"Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she 
will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our 
tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.

On that - just a couple of other things to mention.

1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which 
is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she 
was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday - 
invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased 
with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them 
realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier 
- just an observation.

2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people 
short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest.

3. EnFiber - our valuation/risk management engine (a cannabilised version of 
EnPower) is up and running - and live.

You need to work for Sally Beck on this.  She is responsible for this and is 
a Managing Director responsible for all mid and back office, outsourcing or 
otherwise.  She must approve anything that goes out becuase it will effect 
her directly.

Phillipe is also very reluctant to ""sell"" any systems, especially if we have

fine with most ASP models.  You need to meet with Sally as team on this ASAP.

After meeting with Sally, let me know what everyone agreed on.  I am in all

Subject: RE: CGI Proposal Update

Greg and Rex,

Thanks for the input.  I will try to contact Beth Apollo.  

Here are a few points I think will help.  

? I also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to 
Travis McCullough this morning
? At this time I believe our risk is quite low, as we are not officially part 
of the bid yet
? I will work very hard to keep everyone informed

The following points protect excelr from significant risk:

  1)  We were quite careful about what we sent to CSG (reviewed by Beth, 
David, Rahul and myself)
  2)  We did not quote any price for software or services
  3) The original RFP asked for a custom solution, which CGI is proposing. We 
do not participate in this work.
  4) The option to take a different approach (e.g. leverage existing software 
from a partner) is being proposed by CSG as an alternative approach, but is 
not priced.  The option would be explored during a ""make versus buy"" analysis 
within CSG's methodology (during the initial requirements and design phase).  
This gives us time to clarify our plans.

I hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of 
the proposal.  As the proposal is due on Monday, I am not sure if there is 
time to engage a large number of reviewers, but I will ask CSG to copy Rahul 
and hopefully he can get appropriate input.

- Steve

A brief update:

I spoke with the proposal leads at CGI (Greg Felton and Company) this 
morning, and all appears to be on schedule.

? Greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very 
interested
? Greg received excelr's materials and they are more than sufficient for our 
current proposal needs
? I received a draft of CGI's proposed teaming agreement.  I made made edits 
according to my knowledge of excelr's legal policies.  I will forward the 
document to legal if CGI accepts the changes
? Greg will complete CGI's initial proposal and forward the draft to excelr, 
for review, this weekend and on Monday
? The proposal is due Monday PM to CMS
? Presentations to CMS by potential vendors will occur on March 26th-28th.  
We should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our 
internal contacts to approach the client.  For now we are waiting, based on 
CGI's advice.
? Since the client is in the requirements phase, we should think about how we 
might want to support that process, given our approach to delivering systems 
solutions

Thanks for everyone's support.

		Location		Video Conference  ECN 42C2/OMA 696

I would like to start the dialogue in what will be a series of meetings to discuss the impact of non-spec gas on Northern's system and explore solutions to the problems created by the non-spec gas.  The following list of issues will be addressed on November 8 and at subsequent meetings.  Randy and Danny, will you please select a representative or representatives from your respective regions to be a participants on this project?


List of Issues to be explored:

	Identify the contaminants/gas quality problems
	
	What is our tariff specification of each contaminant?

	System impacts resulting to taking non-spec gas

	Cost to system to accept non-spec gas

	Revenue impact of non-spec gas

	What is the tariff spec of other interconnecting pipelines?

	Possible solutions by region and contaminant/problem

	Impact of proposed rules which will require Northern to post tariff waivers on gas quality

This list of issues will be expanded and modified as this project moves forward.  Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.

Feel free to invite others to this meting that I have not included in the notification of this meeting.

Subject: Commodity Logic

Leslie Reeves is working on the Tom Gros project (let me know if you need 
details on this).  She has asked for top 25 counterparties on excelrOnline.   
In short, there is a new Texas law in the works that will allow for 
electronic confirming of deals, and they want to determine if any of the top 
25 are Texas companies so that we can pursue confirming deals 
electronically.  

Just wanted to get your approval before sending it on to her.

thanks

Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on
Friday.  To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft
that identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict ""two full working days"" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

James has all of the marginal cost information, which can be used to work

lunch today is the right one.  We need to create some customer profiles which 
include the number of transactions at each level and for each of the

which we can gross up to a potential revenue number.

Subject: Deal models

We need to finalize the 4 models that have a high, low and expected case for 
our businesses.  They are CommodityLogic, DealBench, TransactionHub and 
Mid/Back Office.  DealBench should be built as an ASP as discussed, 
CommodityLogic as an ASP, TransactionHub as we have discussed and back office 
as you are working with Sally.      

We first need to agree on all the assumptions for revenue that lead to each 
case suggested above for each business.  We then need to agree on 5 to 10 
years of expenses so we can reach an operating margin we agree upon.  We then 
finally need to look at them and see what capital investment might be needed 
to go in to each one and then finally build a pretax income statement and 
pretax cash flow statement for each business.

The goal is to determine, within a range, the present value of each business, 
based on certain assumptions, and then to determine what they are worth as a 
company.

I know we are part way there on all of these initiatives, but I want this all 
finished as follows:

TransactionHub - Friday afternoon the 16th.

CommodityLogic - Tuesday afternoon the 19th

DealBench - Wednesday afternoon the 17th

Mid/Back Office - Friday the 23rd

Remember, we are trying to get a range that is approximately right that we 
can all believe.

Your thoughts?

Kevin and Dana,

I thought you might be interested in seeing this report on the east. It will
be going out on the internet soon.

There is an interesting discussion on the drought and some drought impacts
which could hype the market abit. We did not intend to do so but nobody
really knows due to the lack of precedents. Before the drought
considerations, I would not have wanted to be short the whole Northeast
JUL/AUG. With those risks, it further makes the case. I personally think the
gas weakness will come late like last year (Aug/Sep/Oct). That is not in our
reference case.

Otherwise, this report is pretty bearish overall.

In the future, I would like to have ongoing discussions with you, and
establish parameters to make sure I economize your time and screen out
material you have little interest in. Obviously, we need to talk about only
those issues that have the highest expected values based upon our
assessments of the market fundamentals and the risks around those outlooks.

Thanks for establishing the relationship with us. Morris and I will work
hard to make it worth your while.

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12""

355,"Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?

Subject: SPP PROPOSED TRANSMISSION LINES

  
DJ Southwest Power Pool To Study 6 New Transmission Lines 
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--A working group within the Southwest Power Pool 
identified six new transmission lines with an estimated price tag of $240 
million needed to ease the region's constrained high-voltage grid. 
     Last week, the SPP work group voted to proceed with a more detailed 
analysis of each project. Most of the new lines would take at least three 
years to develop and build. 
     The projects include: 
     - A 60-mile, 345-kilovolt line in northern Missouri running from the 
Fairhope substation to Sibley substation. Cost: $22.2 million. 
     - A 30-mile, 345-kv line in eastern Kansas running from Wolf Creek 
Nuclear Power Station to the Lang substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 32-mile, 345-kv line in northern Oklahoma running from the Sooner 
Power Station to the Cleveland substation. Cost: $23.8 million. 
     - A 275-mile, 345-kv line in northern Texas and central Oklahoma 
connecting the Potter substation to Northwest substation. Cost: $79.2 
million. 
     - A 50-mile, 230-kv line in southern Louisiana running from Cajun Power 
Station to Coughlin Power Station. Cost: $37.4 million. 
     - A 70-mile, 345-kv line in northern Arkansas running from St. Francis 
Power station to Independence Power Station Cost: $57.3 million. 
     SPP's transmission assessment working group has been meeting to identify 
needed system upgrades since March 2000. 
     A total of 23 known system constraints were analyzed. Seventeen upgrade 
options were studied for their potential to benefit bulk system transfer 
capability. 
     The working group identified the six new transmission lines as the most 
beneficial, officials said. 
     Detailed analysis of each new line and further recommendations will be 
made to the SPP engineering and operating committeein the fall. 
     Currently, SPP has some 50,000 miles of transmission lines and requests 
more than 11,000 megawatts of new generation to be constructed during the 
next three years in the eight-state region, said SPP President John 
Marschewski. 
     ""As a result, there will be a need for new transmission lines,"" he said. 
     SPP, which seeks to gain final approval of its regional transmission 
organization this week from federal regulators, is ready to move forward to 
coordinate the planning process for new transmission, said Marschewski. 
     The SPP grid is often paralyzed by transmission-line relief requests 
from utilities, particularly in the spring when seasonal generation outages 
occur, said Marschewski. 
     While the regional council has attempted to put incentives in the market 
to encourage generation redispatch to avoid TLR events, ""those options 
haven't been exercised to any significant amount so far,"" said Marschewski. 
     SPP has worked to coordinate generation outages to minimize problems, 
but if the region sees plant outages this summer, TLR events could occur, he 
said. 
     SPP includes Kansas and Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, New 
Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas.

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me 
know what you need to resolve the problem.

Thanks,
Brian

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

As discussed in the meeting this morning, here is the proposed order of training topics and breakout of training sessions for NNG:

Accounting Course 1:	1-1/2 hrs.

Envision
Close Calendar
Journal Vouchers and Flash Review

Accounting Course 2:	1-1/2 hrs.

SAP/Business Objects
A/R Reconciliation & Collection/Late Pay Charges
Imbalance Cashout Invoices & Calculations/OBA Imbalances

Accounting Course 3:	1-1/2 - 2 hrs.

GVA/TAS
Rolling Priorities
DDVC/SOL/SUL/SMS
Pathing/Out of Balance

Accounting Course 1 covers the accounting basics everyone uses, and covers the entire pipe.  This is the lowest level of difficulty.
Accounting Course 2 encompasses SAP, report retrieval, A/R reconciliation and imbalances, these skills are used on a daily basis.  This is a more intermediate level course.
Accounting Course 3 is more advanced accounting training, covering the accounting systems GVA and TAS, and the more complex reports for variances and pathing.  DDVC's and rolling priorities are more specific to the north end of the pipe.

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=
=20
current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=
ht=20
timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

To meet Q1 end requirements (i.e. full production of the DPR and stock=20

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

Last night 6/6 Dave Mitchel called at 17:45 to say he would be generating 3mw at 18:30.  I told him I'd start selling the 3's for HE:20 and if there were any problems or any changes to give me a call.   After I had already sold the 3's and bought transmission hour by hour for a couple of hours, Dave called me at 21:45 to say they would be coming on in 5 minutes.  So we sold 20,21,&22 for frontier when they were not generating.

Subject: Summary of April 19 Vision and Values Meeting

Team,

Great meeting yesterday.  Thanks for your participation.  There's lots of 
great things going on throughout the organization!

Below summarizes the key points of our April 19 meeting:

Executive Committee Update
Our meeting with the Executive Committe to provide an update on Vision and 
Values is scheduled for Monday, May 15 at 11:45 for 30 minutes in the 
Boardroom.  Presenters include George Wasaff, Craig Sutter, Kirk McDaniel, 
Dave Schafer, Brian Redmond, Dick Amabile, Rachael Tobor, Gina Taylor/Beth 
Tilney and Cindy Olson.   Each presenter is responsible for presenting the 
key points/accomplishments of their sub-committee.
Presenters, please review your section of the presentation and ""tighten"" it 
up.  Each topic should have ONLY 1 slide.  Submit your changes to me by 
Tuesday, April 26.  
An updated presentation will be emailed to the team by Friday, April 28.
During the week of May 1 - May 5, each V&V rep should meet with their 
Executive Committee member to provide an overview of what will be presented 
on May 15. 
Please provide any feedback as a result of these meetings to me by Monday, 
May 8.
Ken, Jeff, and Joe will receive the final presentation by Wednesday, May 10. 

Excellence Through Communication
Each Business Unit/Global Function provided an update on Action Plans and 
feedback to the ETC survey.  At a glance, all of the Business Units/Global 
Functions find value in the custom questions.  Also, mail lists for the 
October 2000 survey need to be updated and the ease of accessing the survey 
needs to be consistent across business units/global functions.
Dick Amabile will summarize the update and forward it to all of the members 
of the Task Force.
In the June V&V meeting, we will link up with the ETC survey team to begin 
discussions for the October 2000 survey.

Sub-Committe Updates
P&D
Please work with your business unit/global function to identify pilots.  
Please contact Kirk McDaniel (x368251) or Dick Amabile (x33972) with ideas 
for pilots.
The team is currently working the Ad Agency on how to communicate the 
benefits and use of this tool with employees.  
The team is also considering changing the name from Participation & Dissent.

Communication Training
Work continues to enroll vp's and above in the Executive Impact & Influence 
course.  As of 4/19, 179 people (54%) have enrolled in the course with 150 
(46%) people not currently enrolled.
The On-line Basic Communication course is on schedule with plans to offer the 
course to employees during the 2nd quarter of 2001.

Communication Tools
Results of the email survey and best practice interviews were communicated to 
the group.  Action items are currently being developed and implemented based 
on the survey feedback.

Internal Communication Campaign
The campaign will formally launch on May 8 with a voicemail from Ken Lay to 
employees.  We're also working on a short video of Ken to post on IPTV on the 
Intranet.
Elevator monitors will be installed in the elevators over the next 6-8 weeks 
with a target launch date of 6-18.  The monitors will display live video, 
corporate announcements, and Vision and Values messaging along with other 
employee communication.  

Best Companies Initiative
An analysis of excelr's 2000 survey results was presented.
An employee letter from the Office of the Chairman was recommended to be 
forwarded to those employees reaching career milestones (5, 10, 15, 20, 25  
years of service).  Please forward any changes to that letter to Gina Taylor 
by Friday, April 28.  

Thanks again for a great meeting.

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week?

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
- how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?

390,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

398,"Hi Folks,
?
I'll?have the full blown matchups very late  tonight / Friday morning but for 
you last minute waiver wire watchers, here's  something you might be 
interested in:? Chris Warren might be worth a shot  as the Eagles have signed 
him as anticipated according to the AP.? Full  article is below.? I'm betting 
he's still got something left in the  tank.? I'm also betting coach Andy Reid 
is smart enough to figure a way for  him to contribute in some fashion. 
McNabb is not a QB that must be overly  protected so the fact Warren may not 
know all the pass protection blocks isn't  quite as critical as it normally 
is.? He could be worth a  shot.
?
See you Friday morning,
?
Joe

From the article: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/eagles/thurs.htm?  The 
Philadelphia  Eagles have said for weeks that they're not looking ahead to 
the NFL playoffs.  But by adding recently waived running back Chris Warren on 
Thursday, the Eagles  may be thinking about what they need to succeed if they 
reach the postseason.  The Eagles claimed Warren one day after he was waived 
by the Dallas Cowboys.  

Warren, in his 11th NFL season,  will join the Eagles for Friday's practice 
and will be available Sunday against  the Cleveland Browns. 

''He's been in the league 11 years and at one  point he was one of the best 
backs in the game,'' Eagles head coach Andy Reid  said. ''Is he that now? I 
don't know. But he's a big back who has played well  this season.'' 

In Dallas this season, Warren rushed for 254 yards and  two touchdowns and 
averaged 4.3 yards per carry He also caught 31 passes for 302  yards and a 
touchdown. 

But in last Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay, Warren  misplayed a pass that 
deflected off his hands and was intercepted and returned  for a touchdown. He 
was benched after that play, and then was involved in a  shouting match with 
a Dallas coach on the sideline. 

Three days later, he  was waived. Dallas owner Jerry Jones said Warren 
''wasn't in the plans moving  forward,'' but Warren said he was cut because 
he wouldn't accept a one-year  contract extension for 2001 at his current 
salary, $715,000. 

Now Warren  is an Eagle. Philadelphia is looking to add a spark to a running 
game that has  been struggling since the season-ending injury to running back 
Duce Staley in  October. 

The running-back-by-committee group of Darnell Autry, Stanley  Pritchett and 
Brian Mitchell has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in the  last four 
games. Philadelphia, 9-5 and needing just one win in games against  Cleveland 
and Cincinnati to make the playoffs for the first time since 1996, has  
relied on quarterback Donovan McNabb almost exclusively to make the offense 
go.  

McNabb is averaging nearly 75% of the team's total offensive output.  

Warren began his NFL career in Seattle and ran for more than 1,000 yards  in 
four consecutive seasons, 1992-95. He made three Pro Bowls during that time.  

Seattle's career leading ground gainer, Warren has 7,654 yards rushing  in 
his career, which began in 1990. 

Warren signed with Dallas as an  unrestricted free agent prior to the 1998 
season. He has been a backup behind  Emmitt Smith the last three seasons. 

To make room on the active roster,  the Eagles waived wide receiver Alex Van 
Dyke.

The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in

These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there

to Susan regarging International's problem.  Susan said they should have 
caught the incorrect commodity curve load but did not.  Clara is forwarding

Subject: CASH FLOWS FROM EI-GNS-GAS-PRC

Infinity showed a $19 MM notional curve shift change in the EI-GNS-GAS-PRC 
commodity book for 9/1/00.  This change caused a (10,200) PV01 affect on the 
trader's sensitivity report.  After talking with Susan in EI, it was brought 
to our attention that the Bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on Friday, 
due to a change in EI's curve upload process.   This change resulted in the 
Bolivian curve loading throughout 2012, when it actually goes out to 2019.  
The incomplete curve caused  infinity to get bad cash flows.  

As a result, we had to re-do PDH reports this morning.  Final reports were 
given to traders at 9:00 am.

Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
""spring"" internships.

The recruiting strategy at excelr is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair excelr=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer excelr had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join excelr.  =20

The reason excelr has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as excelr's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for ""summer"" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

442,"Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an excelr conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  

It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  

Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --Sally 

Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the ""ibuyit"" and ""ibuyit-payables"" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures.

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.",Non Abusive

Subject:	Quick Summary

Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back.  Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves.  Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.  Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred.   Legal is deciding difference between ""executable"" contracts (able to negate deal) and ""forward"" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale.   South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.

In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking.  However, below is the VAR COB 12/18/01.

continues to inquire about Dennis Rodman's availability.  

*** Sunday Morning Update ? Mike McMahon (Det) is expected to get
a few series this week.  Charlie Batch remains the starter.

Peyton Manning (Ind) will lineup as the starter this week despite 
having his jaw wired after last week's game.  He has been able to

rest of the season.  The team has not officially released this 
information as they refuse to believe it.  Dominic Rhodes will start 
at RB again this week.

needed.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a sore 
ankle.  LaDainian Tomlinson will start again this week.

Ronney Jenkins (SD) practiced on Thursday and will be available to

this week to return kicks and punts.

Ricky Watters (Sea) is out again this week.  Shaun Alexander 
continues to play great in his absence.    

Kevan Barlow (SF) was able to practice Thursday, but then had to have 
his knee drained afterwords.  He expects to play this weekend and is 
listed as probable with a sore quadricep.

International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in 
London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the 
Logistics team.

This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the 
bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties. 
The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report 
to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing 
over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of 
SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and 
reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated 
by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this 
information to the systems and users downstream. 

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by 
Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting 
directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third 
quarter.

A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be 
announced in due course.

  _____  




Location: 	Wyndham Greenspoint Hotel
12400 Greenspoint Drive

Topics Include: 	Major oil companies believe it will work - the $100 million investment 
The Devil's advocate view of subsea processing 
The Regulator's perspective 
Multiphase pumping 
Reliability vs. Intervention, the economic trade-offs 
Ultra deepwater Solutions 
Panel Discussion 





Price: 	$325 for SPE members in advance

DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and 
Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for 
trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 
22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first excelr official 
business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as 
long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.

Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 
22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for 
December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a 
preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that 
you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on 
Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your

A&M / UT Grads (or anyone wanting to become an honorary grad),

 Sorry for the late notice, but we (we meaning UT and A&M grads here at 
excelr) are trying to raise money for scholarships 
for the two greatest schools in Texas (well, one is slightly better than the 
other).  We are having a Flag Football challenge tomorrow
(sorry, all the teams are full).  If you would like to come to show some 
support, it should be a blast!  I have to have the money 
collected by 5:00 PM today.  Any contributions will be matched by excelr.  If 
you would like to contribute to A&M, make checks 
payable to Texas A&M Foundation.  For UT, make them payable to University of 
Texas at Austin (why do they always have to 
call it UT at Austin, like anyone would assume you meant UT Arlington when 
you say UT?).  Anyway, ANY contributions will be 
GREATLY appreciated.  Call me at x54915 and I'll be glad to come get them, or 
stop by my location at EB652b.

Thanks!

Don't forget that it is August again and time to  renew those hunting license's.  We will be leaving to go to Mason on the  evening of Aug. 31st and hunting early that Saturday morning.  Just a  reminder to get your license before we leave on that Friday.  We are  staying at the Willow Creek Ranch homes.  I just wanted to let everyone  know so someone can remember where we are staying.
 
Also, Wednesday evening seems to be a good time for  Pizza and Beer at Kenneally's on Shepherd.  Around 7:00 p.m.  I will  see you there.  Well those of you who can make it.

process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.

Great to see James - I am really warming to his style and we can do some good 
work on promoting a global standard for static reference data control - more 
to say on that next week

Looking forward to Dallas and am planning to return to Houston for Wed and 
Thurs ( with Steve and Richard  - although Richard is leaving on Wed night ( 
something about Valentine's night and only getting so much time away !! ) ). 
Thursday lunch sounds good - you know I love Mexican!! I will try to buy

No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.  I am still in the throws of 
completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00.  
I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown 
before I leave for the day. 

I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom 
and her team.  Back in the Houston office on Friday. 

Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments 
organized for him. 

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, 
Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to 
come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to 
Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for 
summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and 
Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any 
appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule 
allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas 
meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on 
Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family 
will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston 
that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally

      I hope you had good weekend.  The weather in College Station (for the Aggie football game) & Austin was beautiful & sunny.  We never saw the rain.

Here is an update regarding where we stand with Rogas biological resources
permitting:

FESA 10a(1)B: U.S.F.W.S. has mailed the letter to Kern Water Bank Authority
authorizing KWBA to sell credits to EOTT and permitting EOTT to be a
""covered"" third party under KWBA's 10a(1)B permit; however, KWBA has not yet
received the letter. When KWBA receives the letter, they will be able to
authorize the project as soon as they receive the check from EOTT for
compensation credits (I do not know if your right-of-way agreements and
encroachment permits are complete) and mitigation measures are implemented
(preactivity surveys, trapping).

CESA 2081 MOU: EOTT has notified CDFG that the project will commence and who
the project rep is; CDFG has verbally concurred regarding our proposed
avoidance measures (including trapping) for Tipton kangaroo rats and
blunt-nosed leopard lizard; the project may commence on Coles Levee Ecosystem
Preserve as soon as we implement the biological resource mitigation measures
(preactivity survey - submitted to AERA; trapping; etc.) and the Letter of
Credit (or equivalent) is submitted to CDFG for compensation acres.

Bypass Channel: West Coast Environmental was supposed to have submitted
Streambed Alteration Notification and Clean Water Act (Army Corps)
notification within the last couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

500,"In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), ""risk management""  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the ""curve list"" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the ""books list"" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

503,"As I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller for EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the most significant accomplishments are:

Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business while strategic systems are developed.  
	Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated.  	
	Financial settlements has been automated.  	
	Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements.  Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.

People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets.  Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees.  The team includes our London office also.  We continue to recruit for additional positions.

Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements.  Some of these tools include:
Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place.  Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc. can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.
LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG.  This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.
Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to excelr) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.


Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts.  Additionally, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to follow-up with an additional meeting.  I need just a bit more clarity around the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide with my personal goals.

If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.

Thanks for your support.  It means alot to me.

506,"Sally,

Over the past year or so excelr has made a great impact at the University of 
Oklahoma.  In a very short time we have become one of the employers of
of choice within the College of Business.  We have been able to do this by 
paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary.  We have formed
great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to 
come, if we do not become complacent.  I for one am an example of the 
impression
that excelr has forged at OU.  I am here because I believe that excelr 
represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry, 
but the 
but the business world in general.

I am sending this note because I believe we are taking steps that will lessen 
our momentum at the University of Oklahoma.   I have learned that we will
not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall.   As you 
know, last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment 
after our presentations.  Being a student at the time I felt this was a great 
idea and I know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well.  
They felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from excelr 
representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided.  As I 
understand the A/A program now takes the position that this does not provide 
any residual value for excelr and does not warrant the expense.  I do not 
understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an 
arrangement.  It places another selling point on our presentation and gives 
us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent.   This 
may seem like an  insignificant detail,  but I hope we will see the value 
that this opportunity presents.  The students of the EM Program and the J.C. 
Penney Leadership Program are expecting another exciting evening from excelr 
and hate to see us fall short of these expectations.  It is very likely that 
if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will.  The competition 
for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident 
in our recruiting efforts.  excelr is a great place to work and we must take 
that image to campus.   I know that Mr. McConnell is a very exciting speaker 
and will no doubt amaze those present.  That is why we should take this 
simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and 
continue our path to recruiting dominance at the University of Oklahoma.

I am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting OU within 
excelr's sights.  Your involvement at OU is greatly appreciated and I hope you 
maintain
your interest in the University of Oklahoma.  Please consider my views on 
this matter and express any concerns of your own to the Analyst and Associate 
Program.

Thank You,

509,"I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 
1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.",Non Abusive

Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No
Prospects of Protection

The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO ""PERMIT"" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable ""Permit by Rule,"" including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for ""Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total"" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  ""Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time.""  (""Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions,"" <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the ""Historical Standard Exemptions"" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these ""Permits by Rule,"" be sure to check the corresponding
""Exemption Preambles"" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the ""permit by rule"" (don't use the
term ""exemption"" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider ""significant emission reductions"" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Ms. Celina Romero
Attorney
Clark, Thomas & Winters
P.O. Box 1148
Austin, Texas  78767

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an ""engine train
of less than 5,000 hp."" In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of ""engine trains"" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, ""Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total.""  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a ""train"" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, ""Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas.""

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of ""10 year
old BACT"" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

it to be clear to you that the ""deal"" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited 
you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant 
messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.? 
However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with 
Natsource, I still considered you a?friend and thought it would be 
appropriate to ask you out.....and so?I did.
???? As you know, I take things to heart.? I was really upset with

???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just 
want you to know that?I have always tried to do the right thing.? I feel as 
though you are questioning everything I say or do and that you believe there 
are?ulterior motives behind my actions.....and it just isn't true!??With 
that, I wish nothing but good things for you and your family.

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  ""America"" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being  Green.""

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as ""Temperatures of the 80's""

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing ""We shall overcome."" Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share.""

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,""

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of ""fairness"" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She
  immediately called Saint Peter and said, ""This is Sister Margaret. There's
  been a terrible mistake!""


  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The
next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter and called him back.
  ""Please set this error straight before tomorrow,"" she begged. ""There's an
orgy planned for tonight, and everyone must attend!""


  ""Of course, Sister, ""he said. ""I'll get you out of there right away.""
  Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning he

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
""V"" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an ""uplift"" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    ""Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate,"" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    ""Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.""
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to ""pain and suffering"" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    ""We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,"" 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    ""Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.""
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    ""It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"" said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    ""I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat.""
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    ""More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them,"" he said.
    ""But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    ""People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing.""
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles ""quite a 
few"" dog bite claims and he has seen ""a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.""
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    ""There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs,"" Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    ""For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,"" said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    ""We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite,"" Carroll said. ""But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    ""The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises.""
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!"" The man said, ""You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.""

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. ""I tried, but I can't kill my wife."" The agent said, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Subject: Agenda and Speaking Points for October 24 Engagement

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum that I am hosting next week.  There will be approximately 30 excelr 
business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid 
and back office operations for the following excelr entities:  excelr North 
America, excelr Europe, excelr South America, excelr Global Markets, excelr 
Industrial Markets, excelr Broadband Services and excelr Energy Services.  
Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New 
York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000
Time:  8:30 am
  (breakfast will be served at 8:00 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

The group would like to hear about excelr's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
excelr (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to ""raise 
the flag"" on issues if needed 

        
",Non Abusive
536,"Please see the BOD approved limit changes and notification level changes 
currently in effect for today's business, 12/12/00: 1) see Risk Mgmt memo for 
summary of changes to policy, see Policy for summary of limits in effect 
except for Temporary Limits noted below (I sent you these same documents a 
week ago, so you're probably already familiar with them).  As you make these 
changes, I'd suggest revising the order of the commodity listings on the DPR 
to conform more closely with the management / trading responsibility 
organization structure announced November 8th (let me know if you do not have 
the e-mail from Skilling/lay with the attached org. charts.)  Also see the 
assignment of Head Traders to specific commodities below - the EWS memo below 
was approved by Greg Whalley yesterday.




So I'd suggest deleting the South America and Asia Africa subtotals and 
putting under excelr Americas and excelr Europe, respectively.

Other changes we've discussed:
removing Structured Derivatives reporting as that P/L should be aligned 
against power or gas risk limits

Other DPR Issues to address: 
The Risk Management policy requires Loss notification monitoring and 
reporting to be measured without the effect of change in prudency and without 
origination:
Reporting changes in prudency - we'd like this to be a bit more transparent, 
there's Lavorato's ""Management Book"", and Schedule C, and we're not clear 
what drives the changes, so it's more rather than less difficult to 
measure/evaluate trading results
Developing a consistent approach among commodities to report origination vs. 
trading - - - few commodity groups report origination separately, yet the 
area at the bottom of the DPR that says ""US and International Originations"" 
implies that the amounts reported above exclude origination when that in fact 
is not the case
Need to get EES and the UK to report earlier so we can see preliminary DPR 
with all risk and P/L by 8 a.m. Houston time

Temporary Limits and Discretionary VaR Allocations approved by the BOD, but 
not reflected in the Policy above:

    12/7 - 12/22  Permanent
Aggregate VaR Limit  $140 MM  $100 MM

NA Gas    $110 MM  $60 MM  ($60 permanent limit, + $15 Discretionary VaR on 
12/6 + $35 Temporary VaR)

UK Power   $20.3 MM  $15.3 MM ($15.3 limit until 1/1/01 + $5MM Temporary VaR)


Other Limit Issues - I'll let you know if these are extended or modified:
EES's $2MM of Discretionary VaR expires Friday, the 15th
After 12/22, we'll need to re-evaluate the $15MM Discretionary VaR allocated 
to NA Gas

Cassandra.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at excelr.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

Just FYI   -- London is under pressure to comply with the use of RisktRAC  for their VAR info  (not been done in the past) due to their recent limit increase from the board.

We are trying to stay out of it, but just FYI in case you hear any noise.  RAC is not thrilled about the delay

I can confirm that I understand that if we do not get RiskTrac in on the 10th we will have to revert to the old limits, however we are still on track.

Ted,

I believe you are aware that we are working to the 10th of May to start to use RiskTrac for UK Power VAR purposes (if you are not then you know now !). Are you cutting us some slack to use these limits between now and then or do we need to report violations if we are over our 'old' limits between now and then ?

Thanks

James -

Rick Buy's expectations after talking to Sherriff and supporting the new higher trading limits for UK Power are that UK Power's VaR will be calculated using the corporate approved VaR engine - ie., RisktRAC.  My understanding was this would be done by the May BOD meeting which was yesterday, so maybe it's already happened.  Would you please let me know the status?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

Guys, I want to clear up a couple of points:
	a) if you had received a retention payment in early December with a date that expires Feb 28 - that retention payment will not be at risk in any way if you do not work for NETCO or if you choose to join the effort towards NewCo. That payment was made on behalf of the excelr estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained;
	b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks;
	c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.  These are all excelr assets; and
	d) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than excelr's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.

By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.

562,"Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

Subject: California Action Update 1-14-00

excelr has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop ""public benefit"" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

Sally,

First of all, allow me to express my congratulations for your promotion. I am 
following up on the conversation about structuring of the Commodity Logic 
initiatives you had with Greg Piper last week. How do you think we should go 
about looking into the projects? I remain at your disposal for any direction

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the excelr estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company. 

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry but reception is poor on the island!

Have a great holiday.

579,"I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged

If Todd was unaccompanied, we would have paid o2167 p/m.  The flat he is 
occupying is o2817 p/m, difference of o650 p/m. Not sure if this is going to 
be relevant enough to the RC. We definitely could have rented the place so it 
would not have been left empty.

We have a bit of a complicated costing situation. Barry Pearce will be taking 
the cost of the normal one bedrooms at Dolphin Square and Sally is taking the 
rest of the cost.

Hi Jonathan,

 Listed below are the details of each days problems:

Fri, Sep 8,2000
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 8 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the backup file and was on time.

Tue, Sep 12,2000
Similar problem to Friday, but ENPOWER also failed.  The manenpower.txt file 
had TNS errors in it.  AutoRho was not able to kick off the ENPOWER script to 
get the cashflows.  Rerunning fixed the problem.
AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 9 books into Infinity.
It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books 
for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it 
but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work.
Recovery used the file that Jeremy provided in the rerun, they were 
approximately 10 minutes late.

Wed, Sep 13,2000
ENPOWER failed creating a header ONLY manenpower.txt file.  There was no 
cashflows in the file.
Jeremy confirmed the Autorho process was fine.
The problem was the ENPOWER databse failed (hardrive failure) and they 
immediately went to a backup.  But on the backup database, NOT all the tables 
are replicated.  The cashlow table with the ENPOWER data we needed was not in 
the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows!
This problem has been fixed by the enpower people.
Recovery included using the previous day's enpower flows.  They were on time.

Thurs, Sep 14,2000
AutoRho at 3:15 am and 11:00 pm was hung.  Enpower also was not run since 
AutoRho failed.
Reason was because the UNIX NFS file system ""solar"" was full  As a result, 
our directory /worksheets2, and also /prod/egs-home is mounted on solar but 
could not write anything to it.  Supposily the SA are suppose to have been 
paged when ever a file system gets close to 100% (can you please confirm 
this?).  The Unix NFS was fixed by 5:00 am.  AutoRho was rerun and was fine.
Recovery included Jeremy's file.  They were 1 hour late (partly due to other 
reasons on MO side, not system related).

Thanks,
Kevin Lee

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes excelr will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The excelr Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of excelr's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, excelr has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, excelr's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of excelr to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to excelr and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, excelr has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of excelr's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support excelr by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Subject: My Complaint letter to America West


I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the
complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed
the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed
our connection we were forced to spend a combined
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Final Itinerary (after all changes) -
Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM

610,"Bret: I discussed this with Bill Kendrick this afternoon, our suggestion is 
that you forward my original message on the subject to Texaco's attorney 
asking several questions: 1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal 
activities; 2) has the release been stopped and how; 3) has the extent of 
impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto NNG's property or down 
to groundwater; and 4) has the NMOCD been notified. We should also indicate 
our concern that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through NNG's 
facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, particularly 
the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG facility near 
the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains PSH). This will 
allow Texaco the opportunity to notify the OCD. 

In a related matter, I think a copy of the letter that I prepared for Larry 
regarding excavation activities should be transmitted to Texaco's attorney 
and the OCD. I suggest sending a copy of this letter to the OCD because Bill 
Olson with the OCD had asked for a copy of any correspondence that was 
generated regarding the excavation activities and because Texaco has already 
indicated that their lab results did not identify the presence of impacted

I'm assuming Dynegy took samples and must prepare a report for the New Mexico 
OCD?  Maybe we should give the OCD guy a heads up and let him know we are 
concerned about impact to our property?  I'd like to send those photos to 
Texaco's attorney and ask for an explanation... what do you think?

Hi, 

I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help 
me substantiate the EOL commercial.  ABC is threatening not to run it if I 
don't prove that ""excelr has created the First Internet Global Commodities 
Market.""  I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time 
with first.  I know we were, but I have to have it in writing.

Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two. 
Thanks, Margaret

Subject: PIRA Annual Seminar Preview

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for  
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index  and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.


Thanks
JF

1. #16309 - Sassicaia 1998 - $139.99 On Sale  
95 Points - Wine Spectator
""Lovely, subtle yet complex aromas of rants, sage and green olives lead to a full-bodied red with a solid core of fruit and well-integrated tannins.  Still very reserved on the finish, but those who are patient should be rewarded.  Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.  Best after 2005""Have your own tasting notes?

2. #16193 - Snowden 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon - $59.99 On Sale  
93 Points - Wine Spectator
""A dark, rich and firmly tannic mouthful of currant, anise, cedar, tar and herbal flavors, this deeply concentrated Cabernet is one for the cellar. An immense wine that reminds me of a barrel sample; patience required. Best from 2004 through 2010. ""Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
3. #11408 - I Giusti & Zanza 1999 Belcore- $24.99 (Only $19.99 when you buy a case)  
91 Points - Robert Parker
""The 1999 Belcore is a 3,000 plus-case cuvee of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot aged in large, 300 liter barrels.  Its dense purple color is followed by a sexy, open-knit nose offering explosive aromas of pain grille, blackberry, and cherry liqueur intermixed with currants.  Spicy, fleshy, full-bodied, rope, and seductive, it will drink well for 5-6 years.""Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
4. #16394 - Sportoletti 1998 Bianco - $29.99 (Only $23.99 when you buy a case)  
93+ Points - Gary Vaynerchuk - Wine Library
""This may be the best effort for an Italian white wine I have had in a long,long time.The complexity that this wine shows is almost stunning. If you enjoy great White Burgundies then this is your Italian counterpart ! This wine is also straw colored with crisp apple and lemon aromas. Medium bodied with fresh acidity, finishes with hints of vanilla.A blend of Grechetto & Chardonnay this is the white version to the Rosso that just scored 96 points Robert Parker.Have your own tasting notes?

5. #11885 - Paul Jaboulet 1999 Hermitage ""La Chapelle"" - $96.99 On Sale  
93-95 Points - Stephen Tanzer
""Saturated medium ruby. Deep, highly concentrated aroma of black fruits, bitter chocolate, shoe polish and humus. Thick but bright on entry, then quite full and consistent through to the very long whiplash of a finish. Really stuffed with fruit, and beautifully balanced. Dense flavors of cassis, violet, bitter chocolate and Cuban tobacco. Substantial ripe tannins are thoroughly buffered by the wine fat. A great showing today. Jaboulet used helicopters to dry the fruit after the showers, then picked quickly."" Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!

for bonus and LTI.  I assume that I will be able to access the screens for 
merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our 
instructions and time deadlines for merit increases.  I will want to give my 
direct reports access to the system so that they can input their 
recommendations.  I will also want to send them an e:mail with instructions 
and expectations.  Having asked for more funds for the bonus pool, I would 
like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this 
process, we can address any increases that may be warranted given the market 
data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but 
will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have

		 Subject: Compaq Update


	


Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq.   Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.  
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing excelr sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position).   
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.    
  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the ""stick"" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).  This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.   

 So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  

Please let me know your thoughts

",Abusive
646,"Confirming what we thought this morning when we ranked Jeff George and not
Brad Johnson on our week 10 cheatsheet
http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm

Brad Johnson Out, Jeff George to Start
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1101/851321.html    From the article:  Jeff
George was named the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for Sunday's
game at Arizona.

Coach Norv Turner said George would start after Brad Johnson was unable to
practice Thursday for a second consecutive day. Johnson sprained a knee
ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. George missed Wednesday's
practice to attend the birth of his son, his third child.

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million contract in April to back up
Johnson. He has yet to play a down this season and has taken only about 10
percent of the snaps in practice.

""He had a very good practice today,"" Turner said. ""He's into it, in terms of
what we're doing.""  The Redskins have a bye after the Arizona game, but
officials are uncertain whether Johnson will be able to return for the
following game, a Monday night trip to St. Louis.

""He's got a pretty tender knee,"" trainer Bubba Tyer said. ""Grade 2 sprains
could be two weeks, could be four weeks.""  Further complicating the
Redskins' offensive preparation for this week, three receivers are suffering
from injuries, with Irving Fryar the most serious. Fryar, who missed
practice Wednesday because of a rib-cartilage injury, returned Thursday but
is questionable for Sunday.

Albert Connell practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable. And
James Thrash also practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is probable.


My View:  I'm sure Jeff George isn't available in your league but if he's on
your roster, now might be the time to consider him.  I'm not overly excited
though as Arizona has a pretty tough pass defense.  Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 5 in passing yards allowed per game.  For the season,
they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing QB so they're not
quite as tough there.   This could likely be an audition for 2001 as many
feel George is the Redskin QB of the future.  A strong performance could
easily cause problems for the remainder of this year as Washington tries to
sort out the QB position.  WRs Albert Connell and James Thrash are both
listed as probable and should be good to go. At this point in the year,
nobody is 100%.  RB Larry Centers does such a nice job catching the ball out
of the backfield that TE Stephen Alexander has been ineffective.

? We do not need to amend our current SAP license agreement for the

outside entities do not  access data within our environment, but rather 
access an extract of the data from it.  This should work well with the 
current plan.

Allan further suggested that we keep Kathy Kokas from his group posted on our

COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Hi Folks,

A couple of quick notes before we get to  this week=01,s Upgrades and Downg=
rades.

?

Replacing Ricky  Williams:?? Contrary to published reports,  Ricky Williams=
=20
bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to  ESPN.? The wor=
d=20
is that Jim Haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.? Chad=
=20
Morton and Jerald Moore will likely  be the choices with Morton getting fir=
st=20
shot.? Morton=01,s a little undersized at 5=01, 8=018  and 186 but so is Sa=
n=20
Francisco's Charlie Garner and he manages pretty  well.??Morton came from a=
=20
big  time program at USC and averaged 20+ carries a game last year so it=01=
,s=20
not like  he isn=01,t used to carrying the load.?  We=01,ll see.

Don=01,t Count Out Brett  Favre:? According to ESPN, Brett Favre=01,s foot =
is  much=20
better and he may practice this week.?  Even if he doesn't practice, he=20
thinks he may be able to play and keep his  record streak of consecutive=20
starts intact.

Akili Smith Benched.? Not  just benched.? Benched for Scott  Mitchell.? Tha=
t=01,
s gotta  hurt.

Marshall Faulk Raring to  Go?? With Trung Canidate out for the  year with a=
=20
broken wrist, Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl=
e=20
to play this week.? Most  think that=01,s too optimistic but it=01,s nice t=
o see=20
the desire there.?=20



Jeff George to  Start??According to the Redskins, Jeff George will start =
=20
again this week at QB.? Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is=
 =20
Brad?Johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?

?

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Mark  Brunell (Jac)?? I=01,m one of those guys who quickly  points out=
=20
Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he =20
receives but you can=01,t deny what Brunell has done lately.? Behind a beat=
 up=20
line, he=01,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th=
e=20
ball.? Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with Keenan McCardel=
l,=20
they=01,re one of the better WR tandems in the  league.? =20

QB Kerry  Collins (NYG)? A few weeks ago, I took some (deserved)  lumps for=
=20
my early praise of Collins but he=01,s kicking his game up a notch of  late=
.? He=20
looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=
=20
backs.? Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing  but when he=01,s healthy, T=
oomer=20
and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps.? A?solid ground game in Ron Dayne a=
nd=20
Tiki  Barber continue to help the passing game.

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? With  Deuce Staley gone, McNabb=01,s had to shoul=
der=20
the offense and this week he came  through with flying colors.? The bad  ne=
ws=20
is he only completed 47% of his passes Sunday.? The good news is he threw t=
he=20
ball 55  times.? When a QB airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn=01,t=
=20
usually bode well for the team=01,s chances of  winning but it=01,s certain=
ly a=20
plus for your FF team to see that many  attempts.? With that many chances, =
=20
it=01,s like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake (23 attempt=
s=20
this  week) or Jeff Garcia (25 attempts) puts up.? Unless you have a really=
=20
good feeling  about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry, I=01,d think you=01=
,ll see=20
him continue to  throw often.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)?? Remember, this list is  relative.? While he may no=
t=20
be a  starter, Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that=01,s what=
 this=20
list is  all about.? He actually looked very  good at times in the huge=20
victory over Tennessee Sunday.? He showed nice poise coming back after =20
basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier.? Brian Billick did=20
wonders with a  marginally talented Tony Banks in 1999 and it=01,s conceiva=
ble=20
he might do it here  again with Dilfer.? They play Dallas  and Cleveland ne=
xt=20
but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December  3.

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? When I=01,m bashing Mark Brunell as a  Fantasy QB, I=
=20
usually compare him to Troy Aikman =01) Great real NFL QB but not a  much f=
or=20
Fantasy GMs.? Notice a  pattern here?? After being named the  starter Sunda=
y,=20
Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked #  20 over t=
he=20
last 4 weeks.? It=01,s hard  to put too much faith in him but if you=01,re=
=20
desperate for a QB, he could be worth  a gamble.? Tough matchup this week  =
vs=20
Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week 13.

QB Jeff  Blake? (NO)? You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is =
=20
gone for 6-8 weeks.? I hate it for  Williams owners (I=01,m one) but what=
=01,s done=20
is done.? All we can do now is look forward.? And looking forward, I see=20
Blake being  forced to carry an increased load.?  QB Donovan McNabb threw t=
he=20
ball 55 times Sunday in the wake of losing RB  Deuce Staley and I could=20
easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with  Blake throwing a l=
ot=20
more passes.

QB Rob  Johnson (Buf)? I make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching=20
issues but I=01,ve gotta say I think Mr. Charisma with the Spiffy  Sweaters=
,=20
Wade Phillips, is 100% wrong in going to Johnson.? In terms of roster=20
management, he=01,s  hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion.? But no=
ne of=20
that really matters as Rob  Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=
=01,s=20
been named the starter for this  week.? Don=01,t get too excited,  though.?=
=20
Johnson finishes roughly  half the games he starts and the next three weeks=
=20
vs Kansas City, Tampa Bay and  Miami could be brutal.? =20

QB Matt  Hasselbeck (GB)? Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre  this=20
week.? Remember there was even  some talk about trading Favre and starting=
=20
Hasselbeck this summer when Favre=01,s  elbow was a big concern.? Before yo=
u =20
give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck, you should know Brett Favre is=20
reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.? We=01,ll keep you=
 =20
posted.

QB Shane  Matthews / Cade McNown (Chi)? Again, I=01,m highlighting guys mov=
ing =20
up.? With the injury to Jim Miller,  Shane Matthews will be thrust into the=
=20
starting role.? The injury will also likely add a little  fire under Cade=
=20
McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=
=20
Miller was performing well.?  Matthews looked very rusty but it=01,s tough =
to=20
judge a QB when he=01,s thrust  into the game like that.? I=01,d look  for =
Matthews=20
at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then  we=01,ll=
=20
see.? =20

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? You have to keep giving this guy his  props after=20
another great game.?  Although, if you=01,ve got an owner salivating over S=
mith=20
and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.? I=
=20
can=01,t imagine his value being any  higher.? His yard per carry number  d=
ipped=20
to 2.6 in Sunday=01,s game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal =
=20
matchup against Tampa Bay in week 15.? =20



RB Edgerrin  James (Ind)? It=01,s tough to upgrade a guy already near  the =
top=20
but he put in another great game Sunday with 155 total yards and shows =20
little sign of slowing down.? He  averaged 4.2? yards per carry Sunday  and=
=20
the Colts are leaning heavily on him.?  Watch out for a tough November 26=
=20
matchup vs Miami  though.

RB Robert  Smith (Min)? Smith quietly is having an incredible  year.? He=01=
,s=20
put those hang nail  injury jokes way behind him as he=01,s become one of t=
he=20
best RBs in the  league.? He=01,s running between the  tackles for the toug=
h=20
yards and catching the ball exceptionally well.? Keep an eye on that tasty=
=20
week 13  matchup against the Cowboys.? =20

RB Fred  Taylor (Jac)? Jaguar Fans may be distraught, but Fred  Taylor owne=
rs=20
have to be happy, at least lately.? Taylor=01,s running as well as he has i=
n =20
his career, even if his team is struggling.? One can only wonder what he=01=
,d be=20
doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?  He=01,s got two tough weeks coming=
=20
against Pittsburgh and Tennessee.? But as everyone knows, Taylor has a  gre=
at=20
stretch run of opponents in weeks 14-16 when he faces Cleveland, Arizona  a=
nd=20
Cincinnati.? =20

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? If you didn=01,t know better, you might  have tho=
ught=20
you were watching tape from 1998 if you saw Anderson Sunday.? He ran hard a=
nd=20
with the power and  quickness that pushed him to stardom.?? Hopefully, he=
=01,ll=20
be able to  maintain that form.

RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman=01,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke=
ep an=20
eye on that but assuming he=01,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.? He=
=20
scored a TD Sunday and  averaged 4.2 yards per carry on 12 carries.? He als=
o=20
added 8 receptions.? His main competition for carries, Thomas  Jones, had a=
=20
yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday:? 1.00???

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed  for 62=20
yards on 17 carries.??  He likely won=01,t be a factor long as Marshall Fau=
lk is=20
already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=
=20
one more  week.?

RB Ahman  Green (GB)? With Dorsey Levens=01, troubles, Green  clearly shoot=
s up=20
the charts.? He=01,s  an enormously talented RB, but he=01,s got to learn h=
ow to=20
turn that talent into on  the field production.? After a tough  Tampa Bay=
=20
game last Sunday, he faces a soft schedule with the Colts, Panthers,  Bears=
,=20
Lions and Minnesota coming up.



RB Chad  Morton (NO)? With Ricky Williams out for the next 6-8  weeks, the=
=20
logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC,  Morton.?=
=20
He=01,s Detroit WR Johnnie  Morton=01,s little brother and was reportedly e=
xtremely=20
close to Ricky Williams and  shaken with his injury.? He=01,s small  but ve=
ry=20

e=20
Garner.? Last year at USC, he carried a full load  as the featured rusher s=

 New=20
Orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with Oakland, Denver=
,=20
San Francisco and Atlanta all  ahead.=20

??

WRs Moving Up

WR James  McKnight (Dal)? Wow.? What else can you say but give the man =20
credit.? 8 catches for 164 yards  with a TD is a pretty good day.?  Whether=
=20
he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik=
e=20
what he=01,s done thus far.?  He=01,s got a brutal matchup next week in Bal=

but he might be worth  grabbing to play against the Vikings in week 13.?

Subject: FYI -New Product on EOL

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new ""tokenized 
period"" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the

I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

the excelr Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one o=
f our business goals within excelr Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mi=
d and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured=
 into excelr's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that th=
ere could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had s=
ecured our first services customer and were to begin providing these servic=
es on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during Nov=
ember and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much int=

, but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enr=

 we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal s=

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" 
""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" 
""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" 
""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" 
""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at excelr.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Subject:	Working together on the valuation model

All,

As we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model (due late next week or early the next for the offsite), it is important that we all understand and embrace some basic ground rules.  I've got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you have:

In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.  

Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand.  

Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.

Thanks,

Fred

Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Updgrades and
Downgrades.

Enjoy!

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and
Brooks' fantasy owners must be ecstatic.  Brooks has scored multiple
touchdowns in 3 of the last 4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for
the remainder of the season.  With an easier schedule and better decision
making, Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson
and breakout tight end Boo Williams.

QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers.  He has
thrown for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games.  I wouldn't bench
Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now.  He is a stud.

QB - Charlie Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves
recognition.  However, I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions
give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for
the winless Lions.  A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as
Green Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule.

QB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance on Sunday with 311 yards and 4
touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the
AFC.  With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic, Gannon will continue
to post good numbers for the remainder of the season.

QB - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3
touchdowns.  More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb
injury that has been nagging him throughout the season.  As always, keep
Warner in your starting lineup.

QB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing yards and
4 touchdowns.  Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless Lions.
Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks
against San Diego and Oakland.  Plummer might be a good option for playoff
weeks as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16.



RB - Shaun Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in
the lineup.  He scored his 10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly
cleared 100 yards once again.  Look for Alexander to remain the starter once
Watters returns from injury.

RB -  Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better.  The 133
total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the
second half of the season.  Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense
will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games.  With Correll
Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will
not lose many carries to Buckhalter.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears
defense, but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into
the upgrades section.  More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned
to 100% after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly reached the 100-yard plateau once
again.  He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend
for the remainder of the season.  The 49ers offense continues to look good
and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of
starting running backs in the league.

RB - Ricky Williams - The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient.
With Brooks making wise decisions, the offense will continue to get better
and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams.  Williams has
topped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks.  Look for this trend to
continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the
season.



WR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield
and Booker's statistics were directly affected.  He burned the Buccaneers
for 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy.  Look for
more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season.  With
teams starting to ""sell out"" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect on
some play action pass touchdowns.

WR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with
8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday.  With Aaron Brooks making wiser
decisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the
board.  Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners, it is good
news for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson.

WR - Jerry Rice - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from
defenses, Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field.
The career touchdown leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it
look rather easy.  With the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should
continue to see scoring chances.  A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in
your lineup.

WR - Peerless Price - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday,
Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many
fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo.  With
Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams, Price has quietly scored 5
touchdowns on the season.  Price is a talented receiver and should continue
to score a touchdown every other week.

WR - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has
only scored two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage
numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis.  I've never been
a big fan of the Steelers passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for
active duty on a weekly basis.

WR - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week.  Fantasy
owners had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  Look for
Boston to continue to put up quality numbers.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/



Downgrades


QB - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little
bit heading into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor
performance on Sunday.  With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for
the year, Griese's receiving options were limited and his production was
directly affected.  You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is
healthy.  However, the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving.

QB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and was held to 144 passing
yards against a stingy Ravens defense.  Couch should be considered a quality
keeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent
quarterback for the remainder of this season.  Couch should do well against
Cincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England, Green Bay and
Pittsburgh.

QB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup
this week.  With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week, it may
be best to start someone else this week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday.
The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown
passes. The schedule looks favorable for Grbac, but he is struggling, which
concerns me.

QB - Tony Banks - Banks suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against
Denver.  The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and
then taken off the field on a stretcher.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday.
Unfortunately, Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense.
The up and down season for Fiedler continues.  With games against Buffalo,
Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be
considered a quality ""spot starter"".



RB - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday.  He
has yet to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season.  I guess the
toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most
anticipated.  Although we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have
meant the demise of George this season.  First, the loss of lead back
Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes.  Finally, the Titans offensive
line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under 60 yards for the second
consecutive game.  With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run,
Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout
the remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents
(Green Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in
the league.  With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the
schedule for the remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and
down.

RB - Lamar Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to
struggle.  This marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3
yards/carry.  Don't be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger
role in the running game.

RB - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle.  He managed just 29 yards
on 13 carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble.  A running back can
not be productive with just 13 carries.  Keep him on your bench.



WR - Rod Smith - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25
yards on three catches.  He did manage to score a touchdown.  Smith's ankle
injury deserved your attention.  The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines
late in the 4th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the
field and tie the ball game.  The short week will not help Smith's status on
Thanksgiving Day.

WR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing season for Moulds continues.  He was
held to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained 138 on the other side
of the field.  Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills
at this point.

WR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on
Sunday.  Testaverde and the passing game isn't looking very good at this
point.  You may want to bench Chrebet until he is 100% healthy.

WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list.
Heck, I like the guy and think he could become special.  However, he remains
to do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis.

WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable
to play in the second half against San Francisco.  Heck, his production was
not missed.  It's pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you
know what I mean.  If you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean.

WR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status
is not yet known.  He has yet to do anything special this season, but his
expectations were fairly high, so I'll downgrade him



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire


Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on
Sunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns.  He has a talented
receiving crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma.  As long as he can get pass
protection, his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in
need of a quarterback.

RB - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56
yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense.  No other
running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense.  Gay
may just be that guy.

RB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the
Browns, Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against
Jacksonville.  If you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a
roster spot.  If not, you may want to take a flyer on this guy.  The
Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the
door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers.

RB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue.  If Curtis
Martin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality
numbers.  Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot.  If you have
Curtis Martin, get Lamont Jordan.

WR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards and a touchdown.
This marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards.  With the 49ers
looking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent ""spot
starter"".

WR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the
Redskins.  However, he continues to learn the offense and should start
producing very shortly.  Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with a
healthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the
field.

TE - ""Boo"" Williams - ""Boo"" has me excited about his potential.  He's a big,
fast tight end with good hands.  Plain and simple, he has big play potential
and should produce in the Saints offense.

712,"Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the 
excelr/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. 
Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the 
attendees.    

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Over the past several years excelr has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  
The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 
excelr has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  

The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in 
order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and 
(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being 
proposed to Continental include the following:   

exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, 
Originator)  
transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  
creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney 
and Gary Taylor, Originators)
outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these 
products with excelr (Alan Engberg, Originator)

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Meeting Attendees from excelr:
Jeff Shankman, President and COO, excelr Global Markets
John Nowlan, Vice President, excelr Global Markets
Craig Breslau, Vice President, excelr North America
Mark Tawney, Director, excelr Global Markets (tentative) 

DISCUSSION: 
(Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary 
Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)

excelr Buy Side with Continental:

Current excelr verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was 
approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six 
months of 2000.  

excelr Sell Side with Continental:

(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: 

Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been 
managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel 
Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on 
January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, excelr has 
completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current 
business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 
($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)

Value to excelr: excelr has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)

Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 
2000)

Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where excelr exchanges call options 
on crude oil for airline tickets.

(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with 
Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet 
swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this 
product offering.  

Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging 
with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  
excelr could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options 
as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.

Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  excelr 
could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following 
locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and 
Europe.  (excelr is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  
If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and excelr Online 
identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.

(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:

Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that 
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from 
excelr to Continental.

Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their 
annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing 
earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge 
for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not 
difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  
Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather 
conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - 
rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures 
below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  

Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  

Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.

Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to 
various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect 
the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each 
group to attach a ""confidence level"" to each of their estimates - Continental 
could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted 
average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.

Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:

Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.
Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantify
Potential exposure.  Quantifiable
Potential exposure.  Difficult to quantify

For each of the above categories, excelr would also need an indication of 
whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress 
historical weather data.

excelr's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, 
Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or 
others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather 
that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief 
presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with excelr has 
taken place to date)  

(3)  PLASTICS:

Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource 
their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high 
impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with excelr.

Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby 
their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and 
associated reduction in volatility of cash flows

Value to excelr:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they 
hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental 
has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment 
on the potential value to excelr though he is fairly certain it would be much 
larger than $2 million.

Possible next steps
This proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  
Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with excelr.  excelr could 
then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of 
outsourcing their commodity risk to excelr.  Could a follow-up meeting with 
Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to 
facilitate this process?

Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach 
to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful 
and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at 
ways to outsource excelr's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a 
pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model would
include jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, 
plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.",Non Abusive

Secor we all know and love so much, is moving to Baltimore, MD during
the first week of the New Year. I just don't know how the good part of
Texas will survive without her. Just this year Beth won some prize for
her badass painting at the Lawndale Big Show, and she should've won some
other prize for being so damn funny over the years. So here's the thing:

On Thursday, Dec 21, 7:30 - 9pm at DiverseWorks, Beth is doing her Final
Reading. Tickets are $5 and I think all proceeds go to helping Beth
move. Also, she'll  unload a bunch of her old work from the 80's and
early 90's for $10 -$50 that
night. So go check it out. Man, to get a Beth for $50- that's CRAZY! $10
is just insane.

Seriously, Beth is great. Go see her read her hilarious stuff. Go get a
painting. I SO MUCH wish I could go, but I'll be at work. Oh, here's a

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

739,"Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

I received a call from Carl Drachenberg with HMS at approximately 1:45 PM on 
6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and 
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have 
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in 
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on 
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8 
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow 
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.  
The meter is now out of service.

Any questions - you know where to find me.

probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

759,"Hi Larry,

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

761,"The purpose of this e.mail is just to advise you that we will start the 
process of completing two DASH's for two large projects totaling about $1.6 
billion.  The customer is Panda Energy/TECO.  

Subject to Board approval, we would like to sign a contract sometime between 
15 - 20 December.

We have just recently agreed to a price and are now entering into contract 
negotiations.  

We will immediately apply the ""Risk Book Model"" to these two projects; and we 
will begin working a DASH with the RAC group.  Because each of these 
contracts will total about $800MM, I wanted to give you a heads-up.  If we 
can achieve a contractual agreement with TECO and receive excelr Corporate 
approval, these could prove to be outstanding projects for NEPCO, because the 
two contracts are really the duplication of eight similar projects and doing 
them repetitively, should prove very profitable for NEPCO.

me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.

There are a number of excellent sites for radiant heating, including the
magazine fine homebuilding June-July 1992 issue: the Radiant Panel
Association;  ASHRAE  Chapter 6;   Radiantec-Radiant heating system from
Radiantec;  the following web site:  http://www.twapanels.ca/heating
index.html

The above is a good start, and each of the sites have a number of good
links.  Let me know how you make out in your search.",Non Abusive
766,"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded excelr's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that excelr's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that excelr's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, excelrOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.",Non Abusive

Subject: Market Meters Breakout

Brenda,

I am going through the market meters right now and am finding the following 
results for February.

TOM $124,002
GREG      $9,285

I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport 
rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the 
delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to 
pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the 
expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the 
dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the 
dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.

I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.  
This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a 
transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In 
other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper 
record of the transport rate.

As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the 
March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that 
I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to 
attach.

I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.


Heidi

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for excelr were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to excelr deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to excelr's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how excelr structures deals - the ""deal space"" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	excelr deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an excelr deal.

784,"Sally asked that I forward the detail of the ""killed"" EOL transactions to 
both of you.  We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers 
that a deal transacted via excelrOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we 
have continued to see a few of these deals occur.  In summary, we have had a 
total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have 
been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13).  Obviously, the 
ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and 
most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not 
appearing on the customer's summary report.  It is important to stress to the 
Commercial team that the way to ""get out of a trade"" is to do an offsetting 
trade or have our Legal Dept prepare a termination agreement.  Please feel 
free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to 
work with Legal in the case of a terminated deal.

businesses eclipsed the previous records - $84 million set in February and
nearly $80 million in January.
To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. ""We're
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are
staggering,"" said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented
levels.
Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most
of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are
profiting enormously from the energy crunch.
Last month alone, the bill from excelr, a Houston-based corporation, was
$25.5 million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's
Sempra Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light.
City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its
load from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its
power costs.
Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the
Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines.
In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour.
""We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding
cutting off our head later,"" said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman.
Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way.
Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and
Spokane.
Meanwhile, excelr's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion.
Its stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week.
""It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like
excelr are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and
businesses,"" said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.
""There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the
shareholders of these companies,"" Wills said.
Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to
encourage the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation.
Karen Denne, an excelr spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. ""excelr is providing
electricity to a market that needs it,"" Denne said. ""It's unfortunate when
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a
problem of supply and demand.""
The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and
is one of the top ""soft money"" donors to political campaigns. excelr and its
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans
last year, according to Common Cause.
Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns.
excelr doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes
money as a middleman - buying power from utilities and then reselling it for
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North
America.
Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use
of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book
online. You just point, click and spend.
""It's easier than Amazon,"" said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power
""products"" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers.
Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next
hour, next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available,
but it's clearly a sellers' market.
Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up.
""This is pure profit,"" said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.
There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling
the power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities
are paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of
wholesale power.
However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices.
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month
were to neighbors.
Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates.
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281.
That compares with excelr's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an
overall average of $194.
The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour.
City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with
the BPA.
Despite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1
Seattle's ""energy independence day"" because that's when the city will begin
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA.
The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the
open market, city officials say.
But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may
have to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council
has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers
although it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average
person.
Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed,
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded.
Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to
Texas.

788,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

John,
Karen asked me to send you a note about the problems we encountered 
with the final AM processing for 10/26.

When Karen submitted the rollover for the first time, it kicked out
two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help
and the other one she cannot.

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.

opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts will place wide receiver Jerome
Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday.

Team president Bill Polian said Monday night that Pathon will undergo
surgery ``sometime soon'' to repair a damaged ligament in his right foot.

The move will end Pathon's fourth NFL season. The Colts did not announce how
they would fill Pathon's roster spot.

Pathon sprained his right foot near the end of the third game of the season,
a 44-13 loss at New England. He aggravated the injury during warmups before
the Colts played Miami on Nov. 11. Polian said a further examination last
week revealed more damage to the foot.

Pathon earned the starting job opposite two-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin
Harrison, and was having the best season of his career. He set career highs
for receptions and receiving yards in each of the Colts' first two games,
and was the team's leading receiver through three games.

He missed four games before returning against Miami.

Pathon tried to practice last Wednesday. But Polian said the receiver had a
setback before missing Sunday's game at New Orleans.

Pathon finishes the season with 24 receptions for 330 yards and two
touchdowns.

And the hits just keep on rollin' for Indy.   Terrence Wilkins and Reggie
Wayne should benefit as should TE Marcus Pollard.   Tough break for Pathon
who was having a great start.

Thanks to Footballguy Chuck Bailey for pointing me to this one.

PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented?  Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets.

Subject:	El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  ""If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage 
in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.  
With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to 
search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.  He 
averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the 
Hornets to a 4-0 week.  Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early 
in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your 
league.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an 
injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.  He won't travel with the 
team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.  
With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for 
Carter until he is healthy.       

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 
 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position 
in Monday's game against Vancouver.  In what has been called the ""big 
backcourt,"" Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the 
shooting guard.  Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he 
could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point 
guards.     

 Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the 
Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' 
two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring 
punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup 
change.      

 Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.  
He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt 
that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.  Despite the 
injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.  With the success of 
so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his 
Fantasy value.  He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners 
in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.    

 Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.  He 
sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  
Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value 
in most leagues.  His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers 
is uncertain.     

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the 
Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.  X-rays on Atkins' 
ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New 
Jersey is still unknown.    

 Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games 
with a knee injury.  He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on 
September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.  Unless you are 
desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of 
Fantasy.     

 Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee 
against Atlanta on Wednesday night.  He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds 
in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the 
Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. 
The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. 
Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by 
swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn 
hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. 
 

 Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 
 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of 
his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman 
Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on 
the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.   

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 
 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday 
night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The 
fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.   
McGrady's status is day-to-day.    

 Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 
 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to 
repair frayed cartilage.   Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the 
source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst 
near the rear of the knee joint.   Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 
before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 
weeks.    

 Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee 
Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no 
real Fantasy value.     

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 
 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   DeMarr Johnson will probably 
start at shooting guard in his place.  Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the 
only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.     

 Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday 
before their game against Toronto.  Terry Mills was activated form the list 
to take Perkins' place on the roster.  Jermaine O'Neal will start at center 
in Perkins' absence.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 
 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left 
ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is 
probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 
 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had 
been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, 
keep him in your active lineup.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 
 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will 
be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.

Ladies,

To the best of my knowledge, this is the list of items and next steps we 
outlined in our meeting:

1)  ZICI--if errors are made in entry, you must exit and rebook to create a 
2-sided entry.  Diana McLaughlin to review.

2)  ZICI--Prepays on intercompany foreign invoices.  Laurel to contact Pamela 
Lebrane and establish a game plan.

3)  ZICR--report to identify items to be reallocated by trading partner.  Ana 
to create--Rena/Diana to assist if necessary.

4)  BAI codes for activity in Citibank London :  Laurel and Phyllis to 
contact Brian Silver and Lisa Raye

5)  EURO account--items sent back from the bank and posted in USD 
equivalents.  Treasury has been notified and is researching.  Laurel & 
Phyllis to follow up.

6)  ""Not to be posted"" cash.  This causes problems with Cash Application, and 
receivables.  Phyllis/Rena to follow up with Brian Silver & Lori Scott

7)  Autoclear Inflo account--Rena to talk with Becky Ford about putting this 
on as a scheduled overnight job.

8)  Outflow account--Laurel, Cynthia, and Phyllis to continue researching 
outstanding items.  

9)  Yen--Brian Silver & Lori Scott.  Need a solution quickly, as JPY activity 
is increasing--we just had a trader move over to Japan.  

I THINK I covered everything we talked about.   Please feel free to correct 
me!!

I have two options available below. I have not seen these apartments, 
however, so would recommend that you both have a look when you arrive next 
week. Please let me know if you find these suitable. Neither of them are 
located in South Kensington or Chelsea but I think you will find that 
Kensington and Marylebone are also very nice, close to parks and high 
streets, etc.   Also, is Fernley the person from whom I should seek approval 
for costs of accommodation and per diems or is Houston picking up these 
charges?

Kensington High Street - We have a block of apartments here that offer
accommodation of a high standard. They will have a newly  refubished
spacious flat free with 3 bathrooms, 24 hour porterage, Mon-Fri maid
service, and an underground car parking space included.

Please however note that this flat will not be free until the 03rd or 04th
of April.

Baker Street W1 - Spacious 3 bedroom flat in porteraged block close to the

Lynn,

Thanks for your help getting this pushed along.  Shouldn't we take the approach that payment to Northern is expected immediately once Oneok verifies the liquid is condensate.  Whether they ever reach agreement with their hauler or not is not germane to paying us.  We have been pressing Oneok about Mt. Jesus since April of 2000 and provided them with a sample analysis (taken by us) September 30, 2000!  You can see by the trail of e-mails below, they seem to brush us off about once a month.

Charlie,  I talked with Mike Belcher and Jon Hanna about this on Friday for

If determined that the liquids do have condensate in them, we will pursue
retroactive settlement with the current hauler.  Hopefully we will bring
this to a close very soon.  Thanks for patience.  Delaine

Subject: Mt. Jesus Condensate


Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles
Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the
Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton
Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for
picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids
removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage
attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok
monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the
condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table
below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.
This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for
removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease #
71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler
contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is
water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok
accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and
refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement
and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact
condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing
Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of
liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates
that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.
Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from
Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this
matter is appreciated.

Thanks

854,"Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from excelr's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

Car Rental Options for excelr Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage excelr's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for excelr travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from excelr's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for excelr 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of excelr 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the excelr Travel Program intranet @ gss.excelr.com <http://gss.excelr.com/>.

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my ""To Do"" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a ""Blueprint"" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
""Blueprint"", a gap analysis of excelr systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete ""roadmap"" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between excelr Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to excelr Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for excelr metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to excelr Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
excelr Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

Dear Market Participants,

On Saturday May 12, 2001, the NYISO experienced higher than
normal LBMP's in real-time operation for those zones east of the
Central-East interface.
A scheduled maintenance outage of the Edic-New Scotland 345kV
transmission facility, in addition to unanticipated generating
resource outages, resulted in higher than normal congestion
associated with the Central-East interface.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the excelr network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@excelr.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

876,"Guys,

A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of 
April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ.  You should probably take a rough 
count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates.  You 
should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., 
Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.).  Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when 
any meetings like that might occur.   If you don't reserve space at the 
Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, 
etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other 
gathering that has the hotel booked.

Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any 
blockage for the dates you select.  Before you know it the time slots will 
fill up for guys like Randy.  

Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of 
some gift item from the Signature Shop (with excelr logo) for the attendees to 
take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners 
that will join us for the second day of the meeting).  We can discuss what 
will be appropriate.  

A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if 
you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting.  I believe 
you will have to get pre-approval from the excelr group that has to approve a 
meeting of this magnitude.

877,"Sally, Brent and Gary,

In a meeting with Bryan, Jeff, Gary and Markus on Monday, November 20th, I 
showed Bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book 
administrator's Price Verification Comparison Spreadsheet .  I also showed 
Brent this information later in the day, as he had to leave before we all 
left.

Therefore, I find Bryan's Operations' bullet  wrong and misleading.  This is 
not the statement that was made and agreed to on Monday when we all met.  
This statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the 
attachment.  You will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for 
the last six months on Monday.

Please call me or Theresa with questions.

Subject: Debt Trading Losses

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Debt Trading Losses


We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Based on the latest Master Netting Agreement Assignment List, you are assigned to one or more ""houses"" to prepare a Master Netting Agreement.  I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This ""excisement"" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-excelr legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete ""house"" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

Date sent:      	Mon, 26 Nov 2001 15:24:12 +0000



Recommendation:
Roll long TYZs now at 39/32 or roll short TYZ
later in week 2 to 3/32 lower.

Rationale:
The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of
factors. Most important, we believe, will be changes
in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market
movements. Changes in CTD will change the amount
of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of
the TYZ/TYH roll's value.

For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5%
2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with
the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|TYZ/TYH     |TYZ est.|Net     |Est.    |
|Cheapest-   |CTD     |positive|TYH/TYZ |
|to-Deliver  |switch  |carry   |roll    |
|            |price   |(32)    |(32)    |
|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|4.7 11/08   |  111-00|   23.50|    33.0|
|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|5.5   5/09  |  109-00|   28.50|    36.0|
|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|6.0   8/09  |  106-16|   32.25|    37.5|
|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|6.5   2/10  | current|   35.75|    39.0|
|------------+--------+--------+--------|
|5.7   8/10  |  103-16|   30.50|    37.5|
|------------+--------+--------+--------|


Assumes term repo for TYZ at 1.9% and 1.8% for TYH.
Switch prices are estimates and can vary greatly due
to changes in CTD yield spreads.


TYZ/TYH Option Value
In addition to changes in net carry, the spread will also be
impacted by changes in the contracts' net option value.
Implied volatility on TYH options rose 150 basis points
during the previous week. The net option value, (TYZ option
 value-TYH option value) is6.5/32. A 100 bps change
in TYH options' implied volatility should impact TYZ/TYH
roll by roughly 1.2/32


TYZ/TYH 60-day Spread History
Current        39/32
Average   33/32
High      39/32
Low       33+/32

show it to be a sell to Entex Gas Marketing & that's the way I see it as

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a ""gaffe"" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a ""major
league"" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as ""campaign-finance
reform."" But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
""Christ,"" he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
""religious right."" The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going ""negative,"" primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's ""negative""
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and CNN's ""Larry
King Live"" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his ""compassionate conservative"" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it ""negative.""

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two ""test runs"" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

Weren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services with the Heads of Origination?  Are we close to having this?

his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Cummings will be out indefinitely after suffering  a fractured cheekbone.  
He is scheduled to have plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will play more minutes as the backup point guard in 
his absence.    

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Reserve guard Damon Jones left Monday's game in the first half with a 
concussion.  He is questionable for Wednesday's game against Dallas.    

 Tony Massenburg , F VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Massenburg confirmed reports on Monday that he has asked for a trade. The 
nine-year veteran signed a three-year free-agent contract with Vancouver in 
the off-season. Grizzlies general manager Billy Knight said he is not 
contemplating a deal for Massenburg.  Massenburg is a bruising rebounder but 
will have very little Fantasy value wherever he plays.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Payton has been the ultimate Ironman in his career with the Sonics.  His 
game against Orlando marked the 319th consecutive start for him, dating back 
to March 18, 1996, the longest active streak in the NBA.  The last game he 
missed was March 15, 1996, against Dallas when he served a one-game 
suspension that snapped his career-high consecutive games played streak at 
354.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/08/00 
 McDyess played in Monday's game against Denver despite suffering from back 
spasms.  He played 31 minutes without aggravating his injury, scoring 12 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.     

 Howard Eisley , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 He is backing up Steve Nash at point guard but head coach Don Nelson is 
using Eisley to finish games for Dallas.  Fifty-five percent of Eisley's 
total points and 41 percent of his assists this season have come in the final 
12 minutes of the game.  He scored 10 of his 14 points in Monday's game 
against Denver in the fourth quarter.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Williams missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left 
knee.  He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against 
Phoenix.   Williams will be evaluated on a day to day basis.  For now he is 
questionable for Thursday's game against Vancouver.  Matt Bullard started at 
small forward in his absence.     

 Juwan Howard , F WAS - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Howard took a hard shot to his left eye during Tuesday night's game against 
the Bulls.  He left the floor dazed, but would later return to the game. He 
finished the contest with eight points and ten rebounds.   

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Miller broke his right hand on Tuesday night and could miss up to a month.  
He broke a bone in the base of his hand as he was grabbing a rebound against 
the Wizards. He had five points and eight rebounds in Chicago's 88-83 loss.   
 

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sabonis could be back for part of the Blazers' Eastern Conference swing, 
which begins Monday in New Jersey.  He has missed all four of the Blazers' 
regular season games while he recovers from a knee injury.    

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/07/00 
 Geiger, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, went 
through his first full practice yesterday at the Philadelphia College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.  He is eligible to come off the disabled list after 
tomorrow night's game, but the team hasn't disclosed any definite date as to 
when he will return.    

 Sherman Douglas , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Douglas twisted his left ankle slightly during practice on Monday, but is 
expected to be available tomorrow night when the Nets visit the Wizards. He 
is averaging 7.3 points, 1.0 assists and 1.3 rebounds through three games 
this season.      

 Tom Gugliotta , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Gugliotta went through his first practice on Monday since having major 
recontructive knee surgery eight months ago.  He damaged both his anterior 
cructiate and medial collateral ligaments in a game against Utah last March.  
He hopes to begin playing in games in about two weeks.   

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/07/00 
 The Atlanta Journal Constitution is reporting that Mutombo will definitely 
play on Thursday night against the Suns.  He missed most of the preseason and 
the first four games of the regular season after suffering a mild case of 
malaria.   

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/07/00 
 Sprewell was told to watch what he says about Chris Webber joining the 
Knicks in a meeting with league officials on Monday.  In the meeting, 
officials described exactly what the NBA's tampering rules were, and how they 
apply to players.  No disciplinary action was taken against the Knicks' 
forward.    

 Darvin Ham , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Ham will miss 3-4 months after undergoing foot surgery on Monday.  He 
injured the foot while going up for a rebound against the Pistons on Saturday 
night.  Ham averaged 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in his first 
three games of the season.  He will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
either Tim Thomas or Jason Caffey.      

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/07/00 
 Doctors have cleared Coleman to return to the court for the Hornets on 
Wednesday against the Magic.  He missed the entire preseason while adapting 
to new medication for his irregular heartbeat.  Head Coach Paul Silas said 
that Coleman wouldn't start Wednesday's game, but that he would get some 
playing time.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Celtics on Monday after the team released Greg 
Minor.  He played in 54 games over the past two seasons with the Knicks, and 
was waived by the Miami Heat after this preseason.

would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated

Faulk To Undergo Knee Surgery
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1105/860356.html  From the article:  St.
Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove
loose cartilage from his right knee, an injury that forced him out of Sunday
night's loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Faulk practiced Friday and went out for (pregame) warmups after having the
knee drained earlier Sunday, but the knee began to lock on him. Coach Mike
Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only 2-3 weeks. But
teammate D'Marco Farr, a defensive tackle, was out a month with a similar
operation.

""He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there,"" Martz said. ""Really,
there was nothing else to do.""

Justin Watson started in place of Faulk, who leads the NFL with 1,326 yards
from scrimmage. Faulk suited up for the first half, but was wearing sweats
after the break.
Watson scored on a 3-yard run in the third quarter, but finished with 12
yards on 12 carries.

Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season. An MRI on Monday
also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the
loose cartilage.

My View:   Coach Mike Martz called him ""Superman"" last week as he battled
through injuries.  Apparently, he's mortal after all.  The surgery to remove
the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in 2-3
weeks.  If you started Faulk, don't be kicking yourself.  There was nothing
you or anyone else could have done.  As of late Sunday afternoon / evening,
he was still the starter.  You can't control last minute scratches when a
player has a problem during pregame warm-ups.  All Faulk owners knew he
wasn't 100% but we all know he's still one of the best RBs in the game even
when dinged up.  Hindsight is 20 / 20. Let it go.

All you can do is move forward.  Let's look at it analytically:

The problem now becomes a matter of timing.  If Faulk comes back according
to schedule, he'll be ready in week 13 or 14.   Most FF leagues play a 14
game regular season with playoffs in weeks 15 and 16 (or 17 if your league
hasn't wised up yet)  This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season
but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs.

For Teams that own Faulk:  As we predicted, Justin Watson carried the load
for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with 12 yards on 12 carries, although
he did get the TD.  I'd think he'll improve but it's obvious Faulk, not just
the system, is the driving force behind his success.  What I'm saying is
that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George
stepping in.  Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate (if
he ever sheds the candybone label) or Robert Holcombe.  A better option
might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well
right now like Chicago's James Allen, Buffalo's Sammy Morris or J.R. Redmond
in New England.  If you've got a playoff spot secured, don't panic.  Grab a
lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs, keeping
your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery.  If you need a big push
just to make the playoffs, I'd think very hard about dealing Faulk and
shoring up your short term needs.  You have to remember, you've got to MAKE
the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl.

For Teams who don't own Faulk:  The question you must ask yourself is do you
have depth somewhere that you'd be willing to trade away for Faulk?  If you
seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs, it might be a great move.  In other
words, you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be
a bench player for you over the next few weeks. In turn, you get Faulk back
just in time for your playoff push.  But you're banking on #1 Making the
playoffs and #2 Faulk being ready by week 14.  Only you can judge your
chances for #1 but from all I'm hearing, #2 seems pretty darn likely.  If
you've got the playoffs spot sewn up, it could be a great move to trade for
Faulk now.  Don't give up too much.  Don't hesitate to let the Faulk owner
know that teammate D'Marco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar
injury and we all know a RB's knee takes much more stress with the cutting
that does a Defensive Tackle's.  Throw in some comments about St. Louis
resting Faulk for the playoffs.

Speaking of the ""resting for the playoff"" factor - You have to look at how
well the Saints are playing.  The Super Bowl  champs are in real danger of
not even winning their own division.  It looks like St. Louis will be
battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility, the
Rams resting all their players doesn't seem as likely as it did a month ago.
Another reason you shouldn't give up too much in trading for Faulk.  Make
sure to ""sell"" your position either way based on whether you're a Faulk
owner or not.  If you're trading him away, you want to talk up the Saints
and the tough scenarios if St. Louis loses again (the hot Giants are next on
the road).  St. Louis will be fighting for their lives you'll say.  If
you're dealing for Faulk, obviously, you'll take the other side of the fence
and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the
postseason.

The truth, in my opinion, lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed
back into service for the regular season.  Assuming the surgery / rehab goes
well of course.  Faulk's one of the tougher guys in the league, so I have no
reason to believe he won't make a normal recovery.

Bottom line is look at this situation going forward.  You can't do anything
about what's happened.  Make it work to your advantage over the next few
weeks.  Good luck!

I'll see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade Player Report.

",Non Abusive
926,"Load is up in CA and so is the potential for selling load curtailment 
products to customers.


BOTTOMLINES:

PG&E has asked the CPUC to approve participation of E-19 and E-20 Direct 
Access customers in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June 
7).

SCE has asked the CPUC to approve that all customers on its Large Power 
Interruptible tariff can participate in the ISO A/S load participation pilot 
program (filed June 7).

FERC approved the ISO's Load Participation pilot progam and pricing on June 
14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.

This appears to be a total GREEN LIGHT for excelr to move forward with 
customers.


PROCESS:

The utilities filed advice letters.  Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you 
tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC 
has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to 
approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load 
participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.


DETAILS:

SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even 
though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities 
with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the 
following approach to prevent ""double-dipping"" by the customers:  If the ISO 
directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period 
that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE -- 
working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid double 
payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems 
fair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.

PG&E doesn't say much except that it is ""unable"" to offer this to bundled 
customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those ""system constraints"") until 
""later"" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about 
that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn't 
have much to offer on the ""double-billing"" issue -- it said either PG&E could 
change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.

FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other 
munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed 
improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all 
SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to 
charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file 
pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and the 
supposed overly restrictive program participation. If you want to know more 
about the order, give me a call.

Have fun!

XCEL SEEKS $20B UTILITY MERGER; LOOKS TO BUY BACK NRG 

Xcel Energy, one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., is courting FirstEnergy, TXU and Entergy as potential merger partners and at the same time is looking to repurchase the remaining 20% stake of its unregulated IPP affiliate, NRG Energy, which it partially spun off in May 2000. 

U.K. UTILITY PUTS WIND BIZ ON THE BLOCK

U.K. utility Innogy has put its U.S. wind farm business up for sale and hired J.P. Morgan to find a buyer. The portfolio, which consists of two 20 MW farms in California and a further 600 MW of projects in construction or under development in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, could fetch Innogy some $300 million.

UK: excelr to shed metals staff, part of wider cuts.
By Andy Blamey

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Commodities trader excelr Metals plans to shed jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme which should see the excelr Group cut 250 to 500 European jobs in total, the company said. 
""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between five and 10 percent,"" John Sherriff, president and CEO of excelr Europe, said in a statement.
excelr Metals employees in London were told at a meeting on Tuesday that staff cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent would be required, trade sources said. 
The company is seeking volunteers to take redundancy, but if sufficient voluntary slots have not been filled by a deadline of October 19, excelr will opt for compulsory cuts, they added. 
An excelr spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the official statement. 
""excelr's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff said in the statement. 
""It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use to ensure that they are deployed in a way which will maximise earnings,"" he added. 
Market sources were not surprised by the move, citing testing conditions facing the metals trading sector as a whole. 
""At the moment you have low volumes of customer interest combined with difficult trading conditions and high operating costs,"" said one. 
""Even if they're making money from excelrOnline, they've got far too many people there."" 
U.S.-based excelr Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd. 
The number of LME ring dealers trading on the exchange's open-outcry floor has dwindled from a peak of 30 in the mid-1980s to the current 12. 
This could drop to 11 this week if ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , exits floor trading from Friday. 
In an interview with Reuters in August, excelr Metals President Joe Gold reiterated the company's commitment to the LME ring. 
""We send our No 1 trader and No 2 trader down on the (LME) floor every day, which is not a statement everyone can make. Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be,"" Gold said. 
SCREEN TRADING 
excelr has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform excelrOnline (www.excelronline.com). 
The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but excelr is the sole counter-party in each transaction. 
At the end of August the company amended excelrOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. 
In addition to metals, excelrOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. excelr announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.

excelr Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- excelr Corp., the largest
energy trader, plans to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe,
or as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costs
and boost profit.

     The company has 5,000 workers in Europe, and it plans to trim
jobs by 5 percent to 10 percent, excelr said in a statement. The
company wants to make reductions through ``voluntary severance,''
the statement said.

     Houston-based excelr expanded European commodities trading in
2000 when it bought London-based MG Plc, the largest copper
marketer, for $448 million. Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as
excelr's chief executive in August, told investors in July to
expect ``great things from Europe in the future.''

     ``There is still a lot of growth for them in Europe,'' said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. ``They're not
giving up, they're just taking an analysis of each unit.''

Gagliardi doesn't own excelr shares. John S. Herold doesn't issue
investment recommendations.

     excelr Europe is based in London and has offices in nine other
countries. Along with trading, it has interests in power plants in
Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the U.K. It didn't say where the
job cuts would be.

     Shares of excelr rose $1.81 to $35.20. They have fallen 58
percent this year.



Northeast Officials Seek Delay In Unifying Power Market
By Kristen McNamara
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/10/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Officials in Maryland and New York have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the Eastern Seaboard into a single market for the entire Northeast. 
Citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability, reduce liquidity and inflate prices, the New York Independent System Operator and the Maryland Public Service Commission have separately asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study its plan before implementing it.
""There's no need to do this in a hasty manner,"" said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for the New York ISO, which runs that state's power market and transmission system. ""Our markets are not broken."" 
FERC is pushing utilities across the country to put their high-voltage transmission systems - the wholesale power market's equivalent of the interstate highway system - under the control of independent regional operators. The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. 
Power traders like excelr Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. 
In an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. 
But while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. 
A unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. 
Seeking Other Options 

The Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. 
The Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. 
The commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. 
""This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky,"" the PSC wrote. 
The PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. 
The New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. 
The New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. 
New York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. 
FERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. 
As reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. 
Mirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year.

INDIA: Reliance plan could sour BG's Indian deal.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd wants to become the operator of three oil and gas fields off the country's west coast, complicating U.K.-based BG Plc's proposed acquisition of a 30 percent stake in the fields, an industry source told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Reliance, which owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, has applied to the government to be appointed the operator, said the source, who declined to be identified.
That could potentially derail the deal BG announced last week to buy U.S.-based excelr Corp's 30 percent stake in the offshore Indian energy fields for $388 million. 
Numerous reports in the Indian media have said that the deal may be contingent on operatorship of the fields being transferred from excelr, the current operator, to BG. 
A spokesman for BG in London said on Wednesday that the company was ""continuing discussions with the other parties"" and until the matter was resolved, it had no further comment to make. 
Indian state-run driller ONGC, which owns the remaining 40 percent stake in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, has already said it wants to take over the operatorship. 
The source said Reliance Industries, India's leading petrochemicals maker and flagship company of the country's largest business group, is also pursuing management control. 
Panna, Mukta and Tapti lie off India's western coast, and are considered among the more promising recent finds in the country. 
Panna and Mukta produce 29,000 barrels of oil and 2.5 million cubic metres of gas per day. 
The Mukta field produced 1,974 million cubic metres of gas in the year ended March 2001. 
BG said it wants a stake in the fields to complement its Indian interests in gas distribution and liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
excelr wants to leave the venture as a part of its move to focus on the high-growth energy trading business.

USA: El Paso shares advance after favorable ruling.

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A favorable regulatory ruling sent El Paso Corp's undervalued shares soaring on Wednesday, leading the utility group higher in morning trading. 
After the close of trading Tuesday, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge ruled there was no clear evidence that El Paso exercised market power in an attempt to raise California natural gas prices and recommended dismissal of the issue in the case pending before the full commission.
This was ""not a clean sweep"" for the big gas pipeline company, UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said, noting Judge Wagner believes there was affiliate abuse - or collusion - between El Paso's pipeline and marketing segments during California's power crisis late last year and early this year. 
But Barone believes ""the net outcome from his decisions are a substantial positive for El Paso and have significantly reduced the company's limited exposure to this highly politicized California mess."" 
In active morning trading, El Paso shares traded between $51 and $51.69 - their best prices since Sept. 17, the first day of trading following the interruption caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. 
After two hours, El Paso was up $2.50, or 5.13 percent, to $51.25 on composite trading of 1.8 million shares. 
Following it higher were the stocks of several other companies that had dropped on news of California's problems - Calpine Corp. , up 4.14 percent; excelr Corp. , up 3.26 percent, and Dynegy Inc. , up 2.4 percent.

UK: UPDATE 1-ScotiaMocatta seen to axe LME ring trade from Friday.
By Martin Hayes

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange (LME) ring-dealer ScotiaMocatta Metals is to scale back its operations, and will no longer execute business on the market's open-outcry floor after Friday, trade sources said on Wednesday. 
ScotiaMocatta is a unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , who informed metal traders of the move at a meeting held yesterday in the LME trader's London offices. Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said.
""They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday,"" one said. 
This implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. 
No-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. 
Separately, excelr Group said its commodities trader excelr Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. 
On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a ""niche player"", due to the economic downturn. 
The bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. 
Bank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. 
""We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products,"" Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. 
Flanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. 
If ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. 
In the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. 
LME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. 
DOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD 
Trading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. 
This climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. 
""They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months,"" a source close to the company said. 
There had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as excelr Metals 
This year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. 
LME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL 
LME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. 
Now, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. 
To run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year.

LOCAL
UNDERSEA PIPELINE PLAN FACES SCRUTINY ; HEARING SLATED ON excelr PLAN TO IMPORT GAS
David Fleshler Staff Writer

10/10/2001
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro
1B
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

State environmental regulators have raised sharp questions about excelr Corp.'s plans to construct an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to South Florida. 
The pipeline would threaten coral reefs, travel through a popular state park and face a series of hazards in the commercial bustle of Port Everglades, according to a memorandum by the Department of Environmental Protection's southeast district staff.
The Houston-based company wants to bring natural gas from a plant in Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Fort Lauderdale. With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. 
El Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although excelr's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on excelr's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. 
Just before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. 
""The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events,"" states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. 
""Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?"" 
excelr spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. 
""We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions,"" he said. ""We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the excelr project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. 
The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. 
As the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. 
""Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value,"" the memo states. ""In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources."" 
While the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. 
Given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. 
Ambler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. 
All three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies.

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan
2001-10-10 11:34 (New York)

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan

     Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,
India's biggest private company, said it claimed the right to run
three offshore oil and gas projects, challenging a bid from the
U.K.'s BG Group Plc.

     BG has said a plan to buy out excelr Corp.'s 30 percent of the
projects is contingent on winning the right to oversee the
developments. Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India's
biggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the exploration
company and have an option to decide the operator after excelr
quits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.

     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Tapti
and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of an
untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold more
than 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.

     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to double
production in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners in
the venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executive
officer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC has
already claimed its right to operate the fields.

     Before agreeing with BG, excelr rejected bids from its Indian
venture partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation's
biggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.

     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 as
Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significant
discoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurt
growth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries and
hampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.

     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next
six years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand
sales.

     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India by
Electricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulled
out, while excelr is locked in a price dispute with authorities.
The government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producers
and the sole seller to distributors.


LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)

LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)


     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)

     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange said
Scotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,
will cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.

     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floor
trading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, the
world's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cut
about 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, a
spokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected for
now. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.

     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whose
number of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the past
decade because of declining margins. This year, the price of
copper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percent
as slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.

     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplace
because it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head of
commodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.

     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is related
to the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.

     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,
later said the exchange couldn't officially comment on
Scotiamocatta's role at the exchange.

     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formal
statement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslam
said in a statement. ``Any statements about their future trading
must come from them.''

     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''
include excelr Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.


Bin Laden 'look alike' arrested in India
BBC News
October 9, 2001
By Frances Harrison in Delhi 
Indian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. 
The man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. 
Police in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. 
They chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. 
US company 
The bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company excelr on a wind energy project in the area. 
A telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. 
The man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. 
But not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news.

GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
 
If you approve timesheets for excelr Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
 
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for excelr's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
 
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of excelr Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage.  Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
 
Your logon is:   DonBaughman              
Password is:     DBaughman      
Organization ID is:    2160                                
 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi.  Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition.  You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order.  Please contact Gwen Chavis/Craig McGee/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

",Non Abusive
945,"Folks,

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths

sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a

960,"Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read=
 this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages=
 after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will b=
e rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building,=
 excelr Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name ha=
s been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments a=
re finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th a=
nd 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as ea=
ch trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be avail=
able at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with =
your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are =
finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed =
dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piec=
e of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently,=
 we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the =
number lists as a last resort.
=20
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or specia=
l needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need=
 to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or br=
ing supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work =
environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limi=
t access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of=
 a work stoppage. =20

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows: =20

I.=09During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to mo=
ve to the backup location. =20

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown o=
ccurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected t=
o make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.=09After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup locat=
ion as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distrib=
uted.

Sally and Scott Earnest called this afternoon.  We will be setting up a new 
risk book to manage LNG positions on a worldwide basis.  Supposedly, there 
are several contracts from the old E.I. entity related to India for LNG.  
They may reference Dabhol Power project, fuel management, fuel oil, heating 
oil....

Scott desperately needs to get copies of these contracts.  Can you ask around 
with some of the contacts you made on your India trip to see if you can find 
these and get copies ?

FERC Enacts Major Constraints=20
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis








AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based p=
rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions.=20

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FER=
C) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a con=
dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe=
r in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=
ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =
last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =
supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=
d on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=
rving peak electricity loads. ""If you're big enough to control the market a=
t the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you,"" said FERC Cha=
irman Pat Wood.=20

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =
are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =
radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =
weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=
mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =
of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=
ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=
 which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=
king profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=
uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=
d in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=
so be seen as another example of the ""big stick"" that the commission is usi=
ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=
n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=
arkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=
nts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=
pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=
e unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=
nstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=
 an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=
ed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =
Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=
thern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=
ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=
ing its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=
 former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =
to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=
eparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=
hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=
 areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power ""test,"" a gener=
ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=
ty is ""pivotal"" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=
rice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =
be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=
ramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=
in criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=
eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=
evel.=20

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=
inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=
he grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=
ant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=
e secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=
g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=
 are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=
 may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=
pacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=
 have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =
has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=
ntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =
is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=
ded in the new ruling.=20

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=
s to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=
 all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =
will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=
) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =
in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=
e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=
 their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=
 that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =
by an independent third party.=20

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=
wn as ""split the savings."" The methodology for this standard can get rather=
 complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=
dentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=
wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=
o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=
ng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=
ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=
emental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=
 $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=
ion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=
llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=
y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=
ially creates is an ""information advantage"" for buyers who have six hours t=
o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=
he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=
 information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=
e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=
cremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=
 investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=
s that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =
it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=
elieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =
awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=
ey exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=
 providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =
60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=
ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20

I made a previous reference to the ""big stick"" that FERC is carrying relate=
d to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=
ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=
 charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=
cations, advantages that the chairman equated with the ""new world"" of the d=
eregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=
y, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=
ubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=
bited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=
ational RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=
lities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=
n Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=
d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=
er the next five years.=20

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=
enting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=
 pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=
ate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=
ed, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =
have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=
atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=
he ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=
sible litigation.=20

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=
dful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=
trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =
was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =
his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=
 spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=
uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=
ther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=
. Third, the ""split the savings"" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=
th its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =
potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=
er power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=
he bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=
ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =
has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=
s AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=
ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=
lso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=
es are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=
t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=
ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =
areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=
ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=
 market are conducted.=20

below.  If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let 
me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the

a $65 billion tab.

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from excelr to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p,"" says Cohen. ""They don't worry about the bond getting put.""=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. ""We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.""=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They're getting bad advice=
,"" claims one banker who didn't want to be named. ""Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.""=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. ""It's an incredible deal for them,"" says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. ""Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage.""=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. ""I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around,"" says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=
ing the bill.=20

Manager's Journal: What excelr Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of=
 age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=
ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=
CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=
ess. The latest example is excelr, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=
roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, excelr becam=
e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=
licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of excelr's struggles drip with=
 schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=
rage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=
 We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=
eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=
s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=
velations emerge, excelr has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=
ave enduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. excelr envisioned gas and electric p=
ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=
ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=
ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=
rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=
rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=
nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=
r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old re=
gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=
ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=
nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =
by the truckload. excelr pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=
xact needs of the customer.=20
To do this, excelr unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=
 parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=
ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. excelr's investors did t=
oo, because excelr earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=
y, excelr is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""=
process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessari=
ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of excelr's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. excelr extended the logi=
c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=
nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=
nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=
tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. excelr argued that integrat=
ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=
ucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" excelr envisio=
ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=
 bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =
operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=
h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=
 for the economy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=
, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=
peline. excelr envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=
mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=
on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=
 excelr benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=
ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=
nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =
to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=
mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=
y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=
ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. excelr=
 pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=
e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of excelr Online, where excelr =
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =
ability to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from excelr has little to do with trading losses by =
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about excelr's ability to fi=
nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=
os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=
ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=
ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. excelr's corporat=
e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=
ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=
ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- excelr only 15 years=
 ago -- is even duller and slower. excelr became bumptious, impatient, lean,=
 fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=
s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=
d transfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=
n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=
 was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=
arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =
rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =
hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20
excelr was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=
n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=
siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=
 which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of excelr to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=
hment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=
nron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=
itrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=
on's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=
rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=
r industries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=
 contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=
rnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=
ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=
e third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=
tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=
BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
""It has turned into a real stock-picker's market,"" says J.P. Morgan equity =
strategist Douglas Cliggott. ""In the first half, the market bought cyclical=
 stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=
 think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003."" Instead, =
the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=
s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=
 which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=
kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=
roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=
he Asian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=
on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=
. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=
 companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=
cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=
wn 51%).=20
For CSFB, ""it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure,"" says =
Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. ""It was our tech and=
 telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us.""=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=
olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=
 hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =
technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=
cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =
Co. Says Mr. Jackson: ""We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=
est ideas are.""=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=

their lists.=20
In addition to excelr, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=

It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=

 and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=
ent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=
r. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=
 total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=
dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=

""It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=

We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =

On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=

However, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't do=

Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to i=

German Bank Is in Talks With excelr To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

11/19/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from=
 the excelr Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
excelr is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore=
 assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma=
in energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to excelr's decision e=
arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=
tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=
ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=
e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =
likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=
 on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=
=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =
but less than the $:1.4 billion that excelr paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=
id.=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =
Kenneth L. Lay, excelr's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=
nference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than =
we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=
f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from excelr were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=
tLB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =
British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=
ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=
t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=
es.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=
ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for Ne=
w
By Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- ca=
pping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news a=
mid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=
lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=
.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=
panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=
tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =
is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=
 boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=
ecause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =
they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=
OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=
west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=
ions.=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=
ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=
5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=
on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =
a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
""The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=
term commercial paper to long-term debt,"" says John Lonski, chief economist=
 at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=
ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=
n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=
s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=
990s.=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=
 the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=
illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =
payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=
heets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=
e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=
rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=
t refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =
expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=
turing commercial paper by ""rolling over"" that debt, or issuing new commerc=
ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=
 harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=
redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=
ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=
=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =
to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=
es. ""The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=
ts,"" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=
ebt-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. excelr, ham=
mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=
rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =
investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=
ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=
ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=
dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=
le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=
s totalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=
s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=
y.=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=
t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=
rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=
e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=
hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =
that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=
rcial-paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=
 often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=
 of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. ""You can't wa=
it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],"" he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =
far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=
o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=
f last year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=
y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=
e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=
nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=
o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =
2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=
%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=
nt to 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=
s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=
eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=
 up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=
 U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=
ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for excelr, the larger rival energy group, poses =
complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10=
 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t=
o complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval o=
f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities=
 and Exchange Commission investigation into excelr's finances.=20
""It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming,"" said one person cl=
ose to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed f=
or Ferc approval.=20
""(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc,"" =
said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the as=
sociation of US electric utilities.=20
""It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past,=
 marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector =
as it has become.""=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer =
said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two =
years.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the m=
arket power to push prices above competitive levels for ""a significant peri=
od of time"".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers an=
d suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
""Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets,"" said Pat=
ti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consultin=
g firm. ""The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated=
.""=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcul=
ated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market =
power because information on the trading books of companies such as excelr a=
nd Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department =
or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have p=
ipelines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C17
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervo=
us about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism =
worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV lat=
e last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%,=
 according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & P=
oor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=
ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=
titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the ""modern"" r=
ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=
anager of the Russia fund.=20
""But they are getting more open,"" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=
ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=
 investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=
ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
""While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=
"" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=
p 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=
row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=
ope.=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =
the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=
panies and breweries make up the rest. ""There's no escaping oil and gas if =
you want to manage a Russia fund,"" Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=
hile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=
 oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=
ependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=
reatened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=
le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=
 ""You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=
sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=
on,"" Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =
trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =
the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=
han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=
s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=
, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=
k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
""Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?"" he asked. ""The sho=
rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?"" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=
hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =
gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=
cts.=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=
apsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =
its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=
wn almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=
ocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =
third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=
 investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=
he largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=
ter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=
 wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=
mpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =
a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=
nron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=
.4 million shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =
thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =
software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=
ent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =
a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=
y more popular with price-sensitive ""value"" managers. Janus has introduced =
new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with excelr Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =
energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =
withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=
 trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to excelr, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=
ding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=
 the group, in spite of reassurances from both excelr and Dynegy that the ta=
keover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=
atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=
icials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=
nron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=
ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=
 the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as excelr =
use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20
excelr was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da=
ys ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade excelr's de=
bt to below investment grade.=20
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with excelr give Dynegy the r=
ight to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' =
officials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull ou=
t.=20
While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with excelr are r=
eluctant to lock themselves into long-term contracts to buy or sell power, =
said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris, the investment bankin=
g arm of Houston, Texas-based Sanders Morris Harris Group.=20
Keith Stamm, chief executive of Aquila Inc., the energy marketing and risk-=
management company, said his company had begun preparing contingency plans =
in case the deal fell through.

Blackout in the power sector

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been excelr and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the ""reformed"" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=
t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=
n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =
experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=
gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=
cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" d=
id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic.""=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=
 companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=
ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=
 defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =
now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=
urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=
rhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=
 less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=
s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=
oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=
d and the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=
sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=
ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =
sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=
antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =
get out!=20
excelr too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=
 and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=
ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=
e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=
on's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=
ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=
ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=
 exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=
ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. excelr's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for excelr.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, excelr is desperate for liquidity and anx=
ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=
 become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=
 the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =
is the optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=
 and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=
on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=
es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=
s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=
lhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", w=
hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=
icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

As far as dates go we have an excelr BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us. This meeting is in early May, so after mid April it starts to get crazy. It would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate. Rick

Rick,
I think what would work best is a half to full day in Houston.  Then a month or two later to do a check up.
This will allow us to tell you where we think we are, where we need to be and have you guys think about whether you would suggest anything different. 
Over the next few weeks could you suggest a few times that might work.  

In certain circumstances,  i would like to be able to have someone either w/i your group or perhaps a related group (e.g. kaminski) help in the interview process.  In fact,   I have a few candidates cueing up.  One is a PHD, Art Mazer of CL&P and i would love to be able to throw him past one of your guys.  I was thinking David Port.  Do you think i could borrow him for a phone interview.   I would like to do this asap so any input would be greatly appreciated.  Apparently, this candidate knows a few people w/i excelr and i'd like to run the traps on this  He does not claim that these are great ref's because he worked or knew them in limited capacity but any insight is valuable.   The names of the two people are Art Bieser (apparently worked at Entergy for a short time with him) and Alex Huang who he interviewed for a job at Entergy but choose excelr.  We would need to keep this on a P&C basis. 

I had dinner with Marc Tarkington on Wednesday.  I tried to entice him but its highly unlikely given he is paid quite well and the credit role here is somewhat unique.  He sends his best regards to you.

Thanks,
Bill
