Keep it up! The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.

It's only a matter of time before they're going to have to
back off on their support for Al Gore and join the call for
him to concede.

For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayor
of El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliation
from Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirty
tactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.

Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, ""Over 600,000 servicemen
and women gave their lives in this last century to ensure
American freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this same
right. I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when the
leader of the Democratic Party, supported by other elected
Democrat officials take this position. This is the final
straw. I didn't leave my party - my party left me.""

It's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore and
even elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.

And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.  Disenfranchising the
military is as low as you sink.  As American citizens we owe
a debt of gratitude to the military.

The least we can do is defend their fundamental right to
vote.

If you want more info on this issue, go to
http://www.countthemilitary.com/root/A374.cfm
The site is sponsored by the United States Justice
Foundation a non-profit legal foundation that's suing the
Florida Elections Commission to make sure military votes
are properly counted.  They're also trying to put pressure
on the House and Senate Armed Forces Committees to fully
investigate why and how many military ballots were tossed
out of the Florida Election.

I highly recommend that you check out this site and send
any of your friends or relatives who are in the military
to that site also.

Subject: Houston trip

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith tested
positive for cocaine after police stopped him Nov. 11 on suspicion of
drunken driving, but he will not be prosecuted.

Smith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.

NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league was reviewing Smith's case.

Smith denied having taken cocaine, and said he was trying to figure out how
the test could have returned positive.

""I've never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it,"" Smith said. ""I
just hate for my name to be associated with anything like that, ever. Since
I've been here, I've been a good role model, and I will continue to be a
good role model. It's devastating to me and my family, but life goes on.""

Coach Tom Coughlin said Smith told him he did not take cocaine.

""This is a person I've had a long relationship with,"" Coughlin said. ""He
looks me in the eye and tells me he didn't do it, I'm going to believe it.""

Smith passed two breath tests after he was stopped, but police took a urine
sample, which was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for
analysis.

Smith tested positive for cocaine, Assistant State Attorney John Guy said
Monday.

Guy said his office would not prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he
did not have a blood-alcohol level above the state's .08 limit. Smith also
will not be prosecuted on drug charges.

""He didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested,"" Guy said.
""There was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute.""

Smith, who has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in
receptions with 70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he
would play.

He had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds
and spent about a month in the hospital.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


This is something that's been rumored for the last few days and looks like
the rumors had some merit behind them.   You'll have to wait to see how it
shakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still very unclear what
(if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.

Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

PS  - Shall we revisit Agenda and discuss who should start preparing 
presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc

		 Subject: Re: FYI

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12"" 
Hoskins.

The ""Bridge"" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one you 
want, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by excelr w/ ""Bridge"".  That 
spend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as one 
might hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is 
""Hardware"".  I am not sure that is the ""Bridge"" which Kathy Shaps is looking 
for the contract information (if any) on.  

That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a deal 
with (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse & 
Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, but 
perhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS 
may have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly, 
who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).  
You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the right 
person in EBS purchasing, if it's a ""buy on PO"" situation.

Please check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the 
""excelr relationship"" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to 
look for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, 
if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of excelr) with any 
company called ""Bridge"", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or some 
other ""Bridge"".  When I have more information, I'll call and/or e-mail you 
with an update.  I'll also copy Kathy and Kim.

""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.""

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F't know if it=0F's wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F's premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=0F'm jumping the gun.  I can=0F't wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F's
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F't have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F're not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=0F's Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=0F't going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=0F's face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our
industry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every
turn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F' bill, =0F""Here is what

the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall
pass.

I don=0F't buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F't
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=0F's best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join
me and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F't take away your pride,
not yet.

 @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E Complaint

President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San
Diego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are making
choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I call
this the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC to
investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.

In response to SDG&E=0F's August 2 complaint, whereby the utility asked
FERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERC
responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  The
FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC
also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power
market in California.

Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F's Order:

=0F""In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediate
imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we are
instituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206
of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness
of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and
ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to also
investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws
of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient
operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California
and need to be modified

=0F""SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if
sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that
would prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid and
receive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E also
argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and
the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that
the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.

=0F""While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing on
these issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh as
requested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support such
an action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint are
important, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposal
to place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that every
public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the
PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided no
evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise
market power, has not documented a single instance of a seller
exercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt to
show that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval of
market-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary
services have changed.  Nor did it address specific market or
institutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or
unreasonable.

=0F""SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market
structures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&E
expresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestion
management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders
will not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it is
prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;
however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, in
SDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.

=0F""Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...
We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subject
of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.

=0F""It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments
for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its
business decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the
volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when
consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price
signals.

=0F""We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the
real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
...  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources
needed for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practice
put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last
minute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchases
are not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISO
is the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls are
made, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.

=0F""In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately
institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary
to reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipate
the need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peak
periods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of
the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this
analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price
cap authority.=0F""

In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be very
active in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing of
briefs, and reply briefs.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product

Several weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing
a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the
morning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market
instead of the ISO doing the same.

At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTF
position that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Board
insisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do what
ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3
alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F't think about the conversation on super-peak
block markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the Governing
Board, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and should
work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the
California PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out
of Market system.

This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides
discussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and how
it could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many
of its members who either have generation in the State, or import power
into California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how
to bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money
spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year the
total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.

APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,
presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensued
during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might
utilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currently
needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on short
notice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids
into either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peak
firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

We=0F'll keep you posted on our development of this market.

>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response

Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I
did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story
called the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like to
share. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that there
are other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sent
to Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.

Michael wrote:

=0F""I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [the
Gow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simpler
times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and
they typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried to
charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one
in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his
fellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such
behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones that
the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not
be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not
happen.

=0F""In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing
business has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  I
have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,
I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end
results of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can't
afford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimly
perceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social
program, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.

=0F""This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both
scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  But
certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in
my view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of
every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is
responsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want to
live in???

=0F""PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVEN
BLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE
AGE.      Deut=0F""

Okay.  It=0F's in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.

You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F""more personal=0F"" and=
 is
now institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off if
for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But I
don=0F't think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It is
ever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces the
impersonal =0F""efficiencies=0F"" when it is convenient.  Finally and most
importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts
be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might
happen in a handful of years?

However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe that
there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in
California.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your
response.

First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  I
exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my
consulting engagements which require financial give and take between
client and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have been
the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in
my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly
late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,
and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the
use of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the
efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing
of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the
initial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the risk
arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.

I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it has
done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in
the ISO=0F's congestion management reform.  Elimination of market
separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to
execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the
name of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it really
matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through
markets?

Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  What
happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town
down the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant of
Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater
inventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  The
corollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literally
billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  It
paid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will
next year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants under
construction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction in
Arizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects in
California, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits
will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  The
prices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want to
know, where will today=0F's accusers be when there is a shake out?
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But the
alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.

Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you to
develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial
customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher
electricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F't tested the idea
with any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possibly
secured by the credit of participating generating companies, and
executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=0F's simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F's one way to amortize th=
e
earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative
to the sudden growth of demand for power.

Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F't know. One could
argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment
plan for it=0F's consumers.  True, it is no different, because in either
case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative
fees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more
efficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by a
monopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties
other than the utility=0F's customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F't have to wor=
ry
about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this work
quickly.

I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my
members.  Thanks for sending us your letter.

 @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?

Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item. Houston,
the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either
love or hate.  Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber
of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to
cope.

=0F=07   First you must learn to pronounce the city  name. It is YEWS-TUN a=
nd
it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.

=0F=07   Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its ow=
n
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

=0F=07   All directions start with, ""Go down  Westheimer...""

=0F=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

=0F=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=
u
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a ""scenic  drive"".

=0F=07   The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The 5:00 pm rush hour is
from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

=0F=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=
.

=0F=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do not
attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads
to the right and stare at you.

=0F=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent
form of entertainment.

=0F=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=
,
"" Oh, we're in Montrose!!""

=0F=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless they
close down all lanes except one during rush hour.

=0F=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=
t
on at the factory where the car was made.

=0F=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=
ny
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

=0F=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

=0F=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right to
turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!

=0F=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to
avoid major road construction.

=0F=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

=0F=07   Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=
 a
remote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.

=0F=07   ""Sugar"" is a more common form of  address than ""Miss"". So is
""Honey"". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grown
women.

=0F=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that
other soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone
who actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.

=0F=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport: Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main
Concourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

=0F=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, ""Keep honking, I'm reloading"" is considered fair
warning.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Have a great weekend, y=0F'all.

This counterparty's line of business is the distribution of pornography.  I asked Robbi Rossi her thoughts, and legal is OK with the deal because there is no illegality (as long as it does not involve child pornography).  Jane has the company's tax returns.  It is a 1 year on-net OC-12 from Seattle to San Jose plus local loop with an MRC of 22K per month.  This is a transaction which accoriding to our guidelines we would approve with no credit language in the GTCs due to size.  There is no income being marked on the deal.  I just wanted to be sure all parties are aware of what we are doing (Jim and Paul are aware per below message).  Clearly this is not credit risk; however, it seems plausible that there is the potential for this deal to reflect negatively on excelr if it were to become known in the market that we were selling our network capacity to  customers in this line of business.

Jane,

I asked Paul and Jim if there was a problem with doing a deal with Flying Crocodile, and the response was that we will deal with them so long as they contractually agree that they will not use the capacity for any unlawful purpose (which is a standard clause in our agreement).  Therefore, we will move ahead with this.  As I told you earlier, the mark on the long-haul is likely to be negative, and it is an on-net circuit so we can absorb it back if they default.  The local loop is off-net, so I would imagine that you will want some protection on that side.  Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Unlucky 1,300  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/08/wafg108.xml

A U.S. Army special-forces team code-named Tiger 03 ""was credited yesterday with the deaths of 1,300 Taliban and al-Qa'eda fighters and the destruction of more than 50 tanks and other pieces of heavy weaponry,"" London's Daily Telegraph reports. The Telegraph interviews several members of the unit--their full names are omitted pursuant to Army regulations--who describe working with the Northern Alliance:

*** QUOTE ***

Tiger 03 used its targeting expertise for the first time on Oct 28, on a Taliban defensive position near the deserted town of Zard Kammar in the north-east of Afghanistan.

A B-52 bomber following an infra-red designation beam dropped a full load of 2,000lb bombs in a direct hit on the Taliban bunkers.

""It lifted the whole top of the hill two feet in the air,"" Kevin said. ""Mark"", an engineering specialist with the unit, said: ""People were lining up and clapping when we got back to the [base].

""They were slapping us on the back. It seemed like the more accurate the bombing, the better they fed us.""

*** END QUOTE ***

""None of us expected to survive,"" says Kevin, ""but it went just about as perfectly as you could hope.""

Taliban Bank Run  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11095-2002Jan7.html

The Washington Post describes a scene at a Kandahar bank:

*** QUOTE ***

The mullah arrived at the Kandahar branch of Afghanistan's central bank during regular business hours, asked to see the manager, who was another mullah, and presented a check signed by a third, Mohammad Omar.

It was Oct. 16, nine days after the first U.S. bombs began falling on Afghanistan, and this dirt-poor country was once again embroiled in war. The mullah, a senior member of Omar's Taliban leadership, stayed only as long as it took to justify the abrupt withdrawal, open the safe in the basement and stuff $5 million in U.S. dollars and Pakistani rupees into a big burlap sack, two bank employees said today. The sack was then carried into a waiting Toyota Land Cruiser.

None of it has been seen since.

*** END QUOTE ***

Now we know how Mullah Omar was able to afford that nice motorcycle. But he may soon learn that there are substantial penalties for early withdrawal.
Yes, Ministers  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020108/ts/attack_dc_1284.html

While Mullah Omar is still on the lam, three top Taliban have surrendered. ""A spokesman for Kandahar governor Gul Agha said the ousted ministers of defense, justice, and mines and industry had given themselves up to authorities in Kandahar, the former southern stronghold of the Taliban,"" Reuters reports. You've gotta love those Orwellian ministry names. Under the Taliban, after all, there was no justice, very little industry and, as we've learned since Oct. 7, even less defense. They do have mines, though--at least assuming the minister's title refers to the exploding kind.

Oh, to Be in England  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570027-2002012248,00.html

""Fourteen British Muslims are being interrogated in secret by US intelligence agents who believe they were some of Osama bin Laden's most prized recruits,"" the Times of London reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Some being held captive in Afghanistan described how the British contingent had a private meeting with bin Laden just before the suicide attacks in America.

One of the men said that they first had selection tests in Pakistan, and then, shortly before September 11, they were moved to Khowst camp inside Afghanistan without any reason being given.

The man, who is being held in a Kabul prison, said that they were singled out for specialist training because they could only speak English and were taught sabotage and bomb-making techniques.

Appeasement for Fun and Profit  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/08/wchir08.xml

President Jacques Chirac of France is ""embroiled in new scandal"" after ""documents were printed allegedly showing that close aides received kickbacks from a ransom paid to release French hostages held in the Middle East,"" the Daily Telegraph reports:

*** QUOTE ***

M Chirac was prime minister in 1988 when five French hostages held by Islamic Jihad in Lebanon were released. . . . M Chirac and his then interior minister, Charles Pasqua, always insisted that no ransom was paid to free the hostages. But last month the affair was revived after an anonymous memo from the French intelligence service, DST, was sent to an investigating magistrate.

The note was published for the first time yesterday by the newspaper Le Monde. It not only suggests that the interior ministry ordered the ransom to be paid, but alleges that officials kept a substantial slice of it for themselves.

The ransom deal--thought to be almost &pound;2 million--was allegedly brokered between a Lebanese businessman and an aide to M Pasqua at the French interior ministry.

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020114/usnews/14saudi.htm

U.S. News & World Report has another damning article on Saudi perfidy and corruption. Noting Riyadh's reluctance to cooperate with America's investigation of the Sept. 11 atrocities--though 15 of the 19 perpetrators were Saudi--the magazine explains:

*** QUOTE ***

One reason, high-level intelligence sources tell U.S. News, is that at least two Saudi princes had been paying, on behalf of the kingdom, what amounts to protection money to Osama bin Laden since 1995. In November of that year, a bomb at the Saudi National Guard headquarters in Riyadh killed several American military advisers who worked closely with the force. One source, a former senior Clinton administration official, said that the two princes, whose names have not been disclosed, began making payments to bin Laden soon after the bombing. The official added that Washington did not learn of the payments until at least two years later. ""There's no question they did buy protection from bin Laden,"" he says. ""The deal was, they would turn a blind eye to what he was doing elsewhere. 'You don't conduct operations here, and we won't disrupt them elsewhere.' ""

*** END QUOTE ***

The Saudis deny the charge. The magazine adds that ""the Washington-Riyadh relationship is marred by another problem"":

*** QUOTE ***

Over the past decade, the United States has sold Riyadh $33.5 billion in military hardware. That's more than Israel and Egypt combined have received. U.S. companies have also done billions of dollars in commercial business with the kingdom. According to well-placed Saudi sources and a review of several little-known lawsuits, Saudi agents and royalty often demand enormous commissions to accompany these deals. Ordinarily, the payment of such fees to secure contracts would constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But prosecutors say bribery is one of the toughest charges to prove.

South Asian Alliances  http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jan2002-daily/08-01-2002/main/main2.htm

Foreign powers are taking sides in the continuing India-Pakistan dispute. Pakistan's News International reports Beijing is strengthening its longtime alliance with Islamabad:

*** QUOTE ***

In a historic, but, unannounced development, the Peoples Republic of China sharply reduced a marked imbalance between the Indian and Pakistan Air Force by sending five ships--in a space of only 10 days late last month--loaded with cargo ranging from cartons of unassembled brand new combat aircraft and a variety of air force-related weapons and equipment to the port in Karachi, senior Pakistani officials confirmed.

Separately the Chinese government made a speedy delivery of spares and related equipment for Pakistan's strategic assets through Korakram highway, a little before the snow created major obstacles on this crucial communication line between Pakistan and China before Christmas. Pakistan's extensive missile defence system has been raised with an active support of the Chinese government.

*** END QUOTE ***

India, meanwhile, is getting strong support from Israel. ""The world is not divided between East and West,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres  said Monday  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?art_id=1729673309  after meeting with India's Home Minister L.K. Advani. ""The world has a new division now, the countries that harbor terrorism and the countries that fight terrorism."" Israel and India formed a joint antiterrorism commission in July 2000.

Paki Man Fever  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/08/international/asia/08INDI.html

Yesterday at the White House, President Bush discussed the Indian-Pakistani conflict: ""I don't believe the situation is defused yet,"" he said, ""but I do believe there is a way to do so, and we are working hard to convince both the Indians and the Pakis there's a way to deal with their problems without going to war.""

The New York Times (link requires registration) reports that ""Mr. Bush raised some eyebrows by using the term ""Pakis."" It is considered an ethnic slur in Britain, which has a large Pakistani immigrant population.""

Well, whose eyebrows exactly did Bush raise? The Times doesn't say. A clue, however, can be found in this Reuters dispatch:

*** QUOTE ***

Asad Hayauddin, spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, said he did not consider what Bush said to be an insult.

""I would give him the benefit of the doubt and say it was said in passing. In all fairness, I would say it's not a racial slur,"" he said.

He did, however, receive a number of phone calls from reporters seeking the embassy's reaction.

*** END QUOTE ***

The whole ""controversy,"" in other words, seems to have been an invention of the White House press corps.

At Least Dingell Didn't Have to Take Off His Scarf  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13332-2002Jan8.html

The Council on American Islamic Relations, which the Associated Press describes as ""a civil rights organization,"" is ""demanding Northwest Airlines apologize for allegedly forcing a Muslim high school student to remove her head scarf at an airport security checkpoint."" CAIR makes the usual complaint of ""racial profiling"":

*** QUOTE ***

""For a Muslim woman to be forced to take off her headscarf in public is a violation of rights,"" wrote Hodan Hassan, a spokesman for the civil rights group. ""These women believe covering their hair in public--essential to being modest--is a mandate from God.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Once again, these guys are simply demanding special treatment for their coreligionists. If Muslims are so put-upon, how does CAIR explain what happened to Rep. John Dingell? The Washington Post's  Lloyd Grove  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11250-2002Jan7.html  reports that ""after his artificial hip set off a metal detector Saturday afternoon, the 75-year-old Michigan Democrat was ordered to pull down his pants at Reagan National Airport as he tried to board Northwest Airlines Flight 1417 to Detroit."" Dingell was taken to a side room and ordered to strip down to his boxer shorts.
Grove reports Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta, a former congressman, called Dingell to apologize. Dingell recounted: ""I said, 'Norm, I'm not asking for an apology. And I know we don't want any more events like September 11th. I don't want any special treatment. I don't want to be treated any better than anyone else, but I don't want to be treated any worse either.' ""

If only CAIR had Dingell's attitude.

Speaking of Pants . . .  http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/page1/ledger/157de09.html

Here's the funniest headline we've seen all year: ""Switch to Pants Proves Trying for Afghan Men.""

Good Sense Watch  http://www.motherjones.com/magazine/JF02/blaming.html

Sixties leftist Todd Gitlin has an excellent piece--in Mother Jones, of all places--denouncing the blame-America-first left:

*** QUOTE ***

In the wake of September 11 there erupted something more primal and reflexive than criticism: a kind of left-wing fundamentalism, a negative faith in America the ugly.

In this cartoon view of the world, there is nothing worse than American power--not the woman-enslaving Taliban, not an unrepentant Al Qaeda committed to killing civilians as they please--and America is nothing but a self-seeking bully. It does not face genuine dilemmas. It never has legitimate reason to do what it does. When its rulers' views command popularity, this can only be because the entire population has been brainwashed, or rendered moronic, or shares in its leaders' monstrous values. . . .

Generals, it's said, are always planning to fight the last war. But they're not alone in suffering from sentimentality, blindness, and mental laziness disguised as resolve. The one-eyed left helps no one when it mires itself in its own mirror-image myths. Breaking habits is desperately hard, but those who evade the difficulties in their purist positions and refuse to face all the mess and danger of reality only guarantee their bitter inconsequence.

Cartoon Journalism  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64846-2002Jan4.html

In a column on comic strips, Washington Post ombudsman Michael Getler may have revealed more than he meant to with this aside: ""Many reporters and editors don't pay much attention to the comics, except perhaps 'Doonesbury,' the Garry Trudeau strip that parallels the news and the journalistic pursuit of it.""

Right Said Paula  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20020107/en/cnn_zahn_1.html

Over the weekend CNN aired a promotional ad for anchorwoman Paula Zahn. The ad's narrator asked: ""Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart [and] oh, yeah, just a little sexy?"" Yesterday CNN executives yanked the ad. ""It was a major blunder by our promotions department,"" said CNN chairman Walter Isaacson.
 
What's weird about this story is that the controversial part of the ad was the one claim that is indisputably accurate--that Zahn is ""just a little sexy."" The real outrage is that CNN would try to peddle her as ""super-smart."" This is, after all, the same Paula Zahn who, in her Fox News Channel days, managed to make a mockery of the Gary Condit story (!) by credulously presenting a  parade of ""psychics.""  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000866#fox

Bottoms Up  http://web.northscape.com/content/gfherald/2002/01/05/news/RB105COL.htm

Up at the Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald, they're giving themselves a well-deserved pat on the back for winning the award for  bottom news story of 2001  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001644#bottom . Actually, we only nominated the Herald's  story  http://web.northscape.com/content/gfherald/2001/01/20/local/SF120HOSP.htm , on a two-year-old girl getting an appendectomy, as the story with the greatest world-wide insignificance. But since there were no other nominations, the Herald takes the prize. Herald columnist Ryan Bakken interviews the story's author, Steve Foss, now an assistant city editor at the Duluth (Minn.) News Tribune:

*** QUOTE ***

Initially, he was defensive, especially when one of the Herald's reporters (not me) e-mailed his dubious award to his Duluth reporting staff. You know, the people who write stories Foss assigns.

""I'm so happy the Wall Street Journal keeps its eyes on something like this. It made my day,"" Foss said, sarcasm dripping.

Foss' second impulse was to plead guilty.

""I had heard an appendectomy for a 2-year-old was unheard of and that she'd die if she didn't get one,"" Foss said. ""Well, it didn't turn out to be completely what I'd heard. But it was one of those days where we needed a story, so . . .""

*** END QUOTE ***

Bakken notes that the Herald won a Pulitzer Prize four years ago for its coverage of a catastrophic 1997 flood. He quotes Foss: ""This isn't a bad example of what happens at a community newspaper. You write some paltry stories and you can win a Pulitzer as well. At a community newspaper, you go from paltry to Pulitzer and everywhere in between.""

Well, lots of people have Pulitzers, but the bottom news story of the year--now that's something the Herald can really be proud of. It puts the paper in a class by itself.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the

I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably 
starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I 
assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  

What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course 
be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for 
them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would 
prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your 
suggestion on this one.  

After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list 
that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.

I had talked to Ted and he mentioned the cookout you were planning for the OU 
group this summer.  Please let me help with any of the logistics, 
set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,
and insist on helping in whatever way I can.  I am really grateful for what 
you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for excelr.  If possible, we might schedule a 
lunch to discuss the specifics.  I would also be grateful if we could discuss
my most recent opportunity at excelr,  Texas Risk.  I realize the there is a 
great deal I can gain from this move and I would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience.

1.  Question 1: added a comment line after the column headings explaining that Interruptible contracts may be extended from month to month unless terminated on 30 days' notice by either party.  Mary Kay thought we needed some explanation why those contracts showed termination dates in the past.  I eliminated this line, along with the headers, on the CD version of the file.

2.  Question 3:  I just changed the alignment on the text cells for the 3 comment records at the bottom from Centered to Left.

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket."

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
excelr's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

They sent Northern a letter stating they disputed our collection beyond the 6 month GISB window.  I had worked with Kathy Washington and Dan Fancler to make sure the $932,585 would be placed in suspense versus showing up as a receivable on our books.

I am still working with Dari and Shelly on a letter to be sent to Alliant which addresses the GISB standards and the fact Northern believes they are responsible for the invoices.

Attached is the spreadsheet that outlines TNPC's billing and receipt history. There were a few invoices out over 30 days but the majority pay within 10 days after due date, some even before the due date.  Out of the $435k that is outstanding, there is an invoice for $234k that went to the gas desk (James Barker)  today for proof of delivery and volume issues. This amount was not marked on the dispute log. Another invoice for 91k is currently on the dispute log for an undertake penalty and has come to partial resolution. The remaining $134k is a collection issue as collection calls to Chris Miceli have not indicated a dispute, but rather a confirmation to pay. Due to the nature of this customer, CSC handles the collection of this customer internally. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/excelr website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.

prepared last year - we can use this as a starting point.  

Keith - I am going to let you take the lead on this, as it will be critical 
that our customers can reach us no matter where we are....  We can then 
discuss PCG functions that are critical to ongoing ops in case of an 
emergency.   

Let's discuss more next week once Phase 2 is launched and things settle 
down.  However, it is imperative that we develop a plan as quickly as 
possible - this tropical storm could have very easily hit Houston, and we do 
not have anything in place at the moment.

Sally,
Cris asked me to follow up with you regarding the AEGIS insurance policy and 
excelr's reporting requirements which  we met about a couple of months ago.  
Below is a series of e-mail that talks about excelr's obligations as defined 
in the insurance policy.  Please let me know if I can be of assistance in 
pulling this information together.

Subject: Credit Policy with AEGIS



Jim, we are pleased to advise that AEGIS is putting the final touches on the
wording and we hope to have it to you shortly.  In working with them, we
made note of the obligations of both excelr and AEGIS as respects
documentation to support the contract.  In particular, AEGIS is obligated
pursuant to VIII. (c) to provide an accounting of the EAB from the date they
received the premium to the date six months after the policy incepted.
Thereafter, the accounting will be due every six months.  We have requested
this from AEGIS and will provide a statement to you when it is received.

excelr on the other hand is required to provide the following:

Page 4 of 13: IV. Definitions(i) Documents:

     Prior to each anniversary, INSURED
agrees to
     notify COMPANY of any material
change in the
     form of the agreements (ISDA,
Enfolio Master
     Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master
Energy
     Purchase and Sale Agreement and
others which
     govern INSURED TRANSACTIONS).  The
     report shall consist of summary of
changes and
     red lined version of documents.

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY(e)
     Evaluation of Creditworthiness by
INSURED:

     The INSURED hereby agrees to
promptly notify
     the COMPANY in writing of any
material changes
     in the process and procedures set
forth in the
     document titled XXXXXX (Credit
Procedures).

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY (g)
     Report of Overdue Items:

     The INSURED shall remit a report to
the COMPANY
     no later than 45 days subsequent to
the end of each
     calendar month, a listing of all
past due amounts in
     excess of 60 days past due as of
that month-end
     date, which may be subject to
coverage hereunder.

Page 7 of 13: VII.  Settlement of Payments Due by the COMPANY
     or the INSURED (a):

     The INSURED shall provide to the
COMPANY within
     thirty (30) days after the end of
each half-year
     period a bordereau.....

Page 7 of 13: VII. Settlement of Payments Due by
     the COMPANY or the INSURED (c):

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
INSURED must
     notify the COMPANY in writing within
thirty (30)
     days after the INSURED first has
knowledge of
     any loss actually or potentially
subject to coverage
     under this policy....

There was some correspondence in October regarding the report of overdue
items (VI.(g)) and the bordereau (VII.(a)), both on page 7 of 13, however I
don't think that these reports have been generated.  We would appreciate
your assistance in obtaining these in order to provide them to AEGIS.
Additionally, we are obligated to provide underwriters with the revised
Credit Procedures and would appreciate an update on that process also.

Thank you for your assistance on these items.  Please let us know if you
have any questions or assist you in compiling these reports.

fruitful trip for the team.  
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is 
super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy 
in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category 
of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category 
for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean 
sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first 
place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super 
sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every 
time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.  
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on 
both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the 
choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 
awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).  
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed 
like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty 
excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and 
spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!

I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines 
sometime.  

I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of 
the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to 
Houston yesterday.  "

They will commit 100/day if excelr commits to take 50 of it if the project sale does not close.  If excelr does not commit to the 50, they will only go in for 50 and excelr will not have any rights to it.  

Bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100/day of transport to 0-50 per day.  We will need to decide on this tomorrow morning.

placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items.  One of 
the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below.  Evidently, they 
want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can.

We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working 
well.  I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced 
since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators.  As far as we knew 
TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into 
their separator.
TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down 
in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not 
seeing any alarming numbers or quantities.
In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch 
for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, 
then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system 
down and check things out.
PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all 
fall and into the winter.  PG&E might want us to take the system down and 
check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going 
as long as we can before we do that.  
Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.  
(Caveat:  Because of all of the EOTT things going on and other related 
issues, it would help my schedule greatly if we could shift that proposed 
meeting from October 10 to anytime the week of October 16 or October 23?  I 
would appreciate it if Mike Nelson or David Roensch could arrange the meeting 
to be delayed a week or so).  The agenda for the meeting would be related to 
updating everyone on testing results, scheduling the down-time at a mutually 
agreeable time next year for checking the separators, build-out of certain 
facilities on their system related to receiving TW's gas, etc.   
We would agree to do nothing about the 1800' of interconnecting pipe at this 
point.
If you have any questions, please advise.  John Shafer"

All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1

All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)

I got my little review today.  It was a positive experience.  She didn't 
really say anything negative at all- and she even commented that she felt bad 
not giving me any constructive criticism- but that she was really surprised 
at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.

So- I am currently NOT irritated.

ROCKETS GUARD TO SHARE BACKCOURT WITH BRYANT 

  <http://origin.nba.com/media/allstar2002/francis_drive_020125.jpg>Jan. 26 - Houston Rockets guard Steve Francis today was named as a starter for the Western Conference in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game to be played in Philadelphia on February 10. 

Francis will join Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in the backcourt along with Tim Duncan of the Spurs, L.A.'s Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves in the Western Conference frontcourt.

The Rockets point guard, who will be making his inaugural All-Star appearance, held the second position among Western Conference guards when the first returns of the 2002 All-Star balloting were announced last month. He maintained that position throughout the process, easily outdistancing Seattle's Gary Payton for the starting nod.

FOR THOSE OF YOU WORKING FOR US COMPANIES!!
 > -----NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 > To the citizens of the United States of America,
 > In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and
thus
 > to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of
your
 > independence, effective today.
 >
 > Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial
duties
 > over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except
Utah,
 > which she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon.
Tony
 > Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware
that
 > there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for

 > America without the need for further elections.  Congress and the
 > Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next
year
 > to determine whether any of you noticed.
 >
 > To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the
following
 > rules are introduced with immediate effect:
 >
 > 1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English
Dictionary.
 > Then look up ""aluminium"".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You
will be
 > amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
Generally,
 > you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up
 > ""vocabulary"".  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with

 > filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and

 > inefficient form of communication.  Look up ""interspersed"".
 >
 > 2. There is no such thing as ""US English"".  We will let Microsoft
know
 > on your behalf.
 >
 > 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian
accents. It
 > really isn't that hard.
 >
 > 4.      Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English
actors as
 > the good  guys.
 >
 > 5.      You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God
Save The
 > Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not
want you
 > to get confused and give up half way through.
 >
 > 6.      You should stop playing American ""football"".  There is
only
 > one kind of football.  What you refer to as American ""football"" is
not
 > a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a
world
 > outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays
""American""
 > football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should
instead
 > play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played
with
 > the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough
will, in
 > time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American
 > ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty
 > seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).  We are
 > hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.
 >
 > 7.      You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear

 > weapons if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were
not
 > aware that there is a world outside your borders should count
yourselves
 > lucky.  The Russians have never been the bad guys.  ""Merde"" is
French for
 > ""shit"".
 >
 > 8.      July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will
be a
 > new national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called
""Indecisive
 > Day"".
 >
 > 9.      All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it
is for
 > your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand
what we

crazy.

better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue 
model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we 
are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our 
revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  
Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect 
that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost 
centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out 
where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as 
revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should 
be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of 
the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses 
that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I 
don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated 
to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.

Subject: Forecast for 2001

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical 
issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved 
over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an 
excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as 
the site was brought back up.

A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Subject: New Profit Centers

Bob, 

Per our conversation -  on this past Tuesday, a group met from VM, Gas Acctg. 
and East Risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central 
desks to SAP. Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will 
record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were 
done in Feb.'s g/l).  According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each 
of the profit centers (19 in total).  As we discussed, VM does not have the 
appropriate Unify reports or manpower to  support this level of accounting at 
this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the 
past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the 
UA4 calc. to match us.  With the foresight of eventually going to profit 
center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant 
changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower 
level of reporting.  I believe the flash is already being done at the 
different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing 
their analysis at a more consolidated level.  There were discussions in the 
meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion 
that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the 
organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will 
need to be able to handle this level of detail.  Of course, no decisions were 
made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain 
unchanged for this month.  Please let me know if you want to discuss 
further.  Thanks!

Subject:	FW: EOGIL sale to BG

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow ""form of agreement"".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation."

Subject:	Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'excelr' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject:	Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility (""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within excelr
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple

we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)
Total Value =                                   $172,000

Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Subject: ""Megafill""

I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. Terraso.

The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being 
abandoned in place.  He will send me some promotional information.  

Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at  
http://www.roartech.com/megafill/ claiming that:

Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day.

 The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity
 (in most cases 100%).

Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA).

Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines.

No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines.

Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water
created by the rinsing method of abandonment.

No waiting for test results.

No cost for analytical.

GPS equipped trucks.

He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42"" diameter.

Dear WineCommune Member,

The WineCommune community has grown over the past three years from an informal message board for buying and selling wine, to an impressive worldwide exchange with a user base of over 10,000 members. Since 1999, we have been proud to offer you free membership and no-cost usership. WineCommune now has the second largest membership base and it is the third largest Internet wine auction company by volume. We have built a business that is secure and reputable, with a client base of loyal users whose participation and feedback have helped us become what we are today.

We want to go further and provide you with an even better place on the Internet to buy and sell wine. We want to add more features, make the site faster, and make it more secure. In order to do that, however, we have to begin charging a modest commission. Beginning with lots posted on Monday, November 5, 2001, sellers will be charged a 3% commission for all successful auctions. Bidding and buying will remain free - fees only apply to the seller. The new fees are the lowest in the wine auction industry - online or offline. Other wine auctions charge as much as 12% to the buyer AND 12% to the seller.

What are we going to do with the commission?  Over the next several months look for the following new services:

1. Increased advertising to attract new members
2. Enhanced customer service
3. Platinum Seller Program - a way to reward sellers with proven track records
4. Greater protection for buyers
5. New ways to buy and sell

We believe the new charge to sellers is competitive and fair, and hope you agree. With this change, we are committed to providing you with the fastest and easiest method for selling and buying wine. Please continue to provide us with comments and suggestions on ways of enhancing our service. We value your membership and are grateful for your continued patronage and support. Thank you for helping us make WineCommune the #1 wine auction community.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at contact@winecommune.com.

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 ""at the latest"".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely,"" said Marbury. ""I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable.""  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20

 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who wa=
s=20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=

Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=

178,19294,bass-e/notes_inbox/570.,<13081562.1075854681625.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Well,

I'm  back.  JRTC was a helluva lot better than I thought it would be.  It
was a month long, and though at times more boring then anything I have ever
experienced in my entire life, I still got to get attacked by an actual
Hind-D helicopter, Soviet BRDM's, suicide squads with backpacks stuffed with
chemical weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations centers
(TOC) then detonate themselves.

Basically it went like this.

As soon as we got there we started preping for a Light/Heavy Combined Arms
Deliberate Attack Live Fire Exercise.  Basically what this came down to was
we had 155mm and 105mm howitzers, and 81mm mortars with more ammo then you
will ever see in an excercise. Kiowas, M1A2's Bradley's, Tow vehicles,
engineer platoon, and a dismounted platoon.  Our job was to assault through
a bunker complex to set up a support by fire (SBF) posn in order to
facilitate the main efforts assault on the Battalion's (Bn) main obj.

Basically what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to bunker
complex, smash bunker complex, continue smashing path to SBF posn. Once at
SBF posn, smash (put hellacious ammounts of steel on) the Bn  main obj for
15+ minutes to allow a notional Bn Main effort to get up to the obj,
unmolested.

Needles to say it was awesome, I will never see that many assets together,
using that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really bad
somewhere and we go do it for real,  after experiencing this there is no way
in high holy hell I would ever want to be anywhere near the recieving end of
this hellstorm.  It was my first act out of OBC with my Company and the Live
Fire O/C thought I did well enough to warrant recieving a Division coin,

As far as the actual JRTC rotation went it was pretty boring compared to the
Live Fire.  It was four phases, 1. Entry into the Box (seizing an
airfield/foothold) 2.Low Intensity Conflict (LIC) 3. Attack on
Shugart-Gordon (MOUT stuff) 4. Defense.

The only exciting stuff came in phases 1 and 4 when we actually had heavy
contact.  4 was especially cool cause me and my guys were personally
responsible so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to breach
our obstacles in order to pass their main effort of 60 armored vehicles (30
T-62's, and 30 BRDMs) that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated and
tried again (by this time our plt defending the obstacle was wiped out,)
But guess what, my Forward Observer wasn't with the Platoon but was in an OP
closer to the obstacle,  the bad guys smashed the platoons posn and thought
it was safe to try again on breachin the obstacle.  We called a mass repeat
on the obstacle (60 rounds of 155, 105 and 81mm)  needless to say they got
the hell outta there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of smoking
vehicle hulls and a mound dead dismounts.  As a result of destroying their
breach effort we turned them back into the Brigades main Engagement Area
where the Armor guys slugged it out with them for awhile.

Anyways,  JRTC was fun,  if you like ur people, any deployment will be fun,
Louisianna was nice, a welcome change to this Island stuff,  plus the
terrain looked just like home.  In fact it was 1 and a half hours away from
your deer camp Bill, I was tempted to just pack it up and take off walkin
and just wait fer opening day.

Well this concludes my post JRTC brief, any quetions?

I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understanding of where we are on that front.

I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about.  I am going to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon.

I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/demand question accurately.  I also need to follow up on the permits and see where they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of other items.

Talk to you soon.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of excelr.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of excelr's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at excelr, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore excelr to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Subject: Hourly books out of balance

Kayne,

We have discussed the real-time books being flat by 6:30 A.M. in the past and 
I just want to reiterate the importance of that task.  We run a report that 
checks the east positions to ensure that we as a company are flat on a daily 
basis.  Every morning that I can remember for the past few weeks one or all 
of the real-time desks are not flat with the term or cash books causing our 
group to spend time finding the problem and than fixing it.  We have a noon 
deadline to report P&L to  upper management.  When we miss this deadline we 
are forced to document the causes to the Corporate reporting group.  We are 
normally able to rush through and meet our deadline in the nick of time.  
Could you please institute a policy in which the night group checks the 
positions and ensures that all of the real-time desks are flat prior to 6:30 
A.M.  I know we keep bugging you about this problem but it needs to be 
addressed as we have reached a point where our group cannot even start our 
daily tasks until 9:30 - 10:00 every day.  When we came in this morning the 
only real-time desk to be flat was the Hourly Midwest desk.  Let me know if 
our group can help in any way.


Thank you

Sally - it was great seeing you last week at the ASE in Dallas.  I'm sorry we 
didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.  As you 
may know,  I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my 
current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP 
HR.
  
To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to 
interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.  You have been 
identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I 
would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and 
have your admin spend another hour with them as well -- times noted below.

Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this 
initiative.  It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to 
develop what excelr needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this 
process.  Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and 
I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.

Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.  If you have any 
questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 
3-0363.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Proposed agenda
We would like to interview managers and their administrators.

 9:30 - 10:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1
10:00 - 11:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1
  
 1:00 -  1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2
 1:30 -  2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2

 2:30 -  3:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3
 3:00 -  4:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3

What is this project?
SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with the
Workplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at
all levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the
HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout
SAP in the U.S. and Germany.

SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close
to our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight
SAP customers in the U.S. excelr is one of the eight companies we would like
to visit.

Who do we want to interview and observe?
In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of
managers.
* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget
responsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to
delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.
* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small
subsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and
personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have
product-planning responsibilities.
* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as
accounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also
involved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and
lower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.

What can you expect during a site visit?
We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to
meet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then 
escort us to our
interviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their
objectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations
where our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her
daily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with 
his/her
administrative assistant.

Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people
where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of
insights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to
be completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive
information with utmost confidentiality.

There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and 
administrative assistants from 
various areas in various business units.

summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
studied.  If so, who produced it.

I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.


I would really appreciate it.

Late,
GM

		 Subject: Re-cap of Rep Caucus Briefing

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

Here is the email I sent Lynn regarding having Raetta and I on a different floor than the NNG MS Reps.   Again, I am very AGAINST having Raetta and I seperated from the NNG MS reps on a different floor. It will create confusion and be a disruption to our jobs.

See me if you have any questions.

Subject:	Concerns 

Lynn,

I wanted to express my concerns of having Raetta and I located on another floor, away from the NNG teams.  Raetta and I deal with the MS Reps daily on the following items:

*Approving all Journal Vouchers and Wire transfer requests
*Questions from all NNG reps concerning rates on invoices, volume allocations, imbalances, accounts receivables, etc.
*Sitting in on conference calls with the reps and customers (or marketers) concerning invoices, imbalances, accounts receivable, etc
*Meeting with you every morning and through the day on various customer issues and questions


During the Reservation close cycle (approximately 6 work days), Raetta and I need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting
*Distribution of the South Region Flash report (Craig Buehler's report) and reviewing it

During the Commodity PPA close cycle (approximately 5 work days), we would need to be on same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary transportation, penalty and imbalances invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS and GVA error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them

During the current month Commodity close cycle (approximately 4 work days), we would need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting

The total number of days I have just listed are 15 work days. The maximum number of work days a month totals at 22.  Therefore, approximately 3 weeks out of the month, Raetta and I would have to be on the floor daily.  In this totals, I am NOT including the 3 work days it takes me to meet with reps on NNG OBA imbalances to gather and analyze information for the Customer Accounts meeting.

As you can see, it is very important for Raetta and myself to remain on the floor with the MS reps.  See me if you need further details.

Larry

JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Attachment A of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, as posted, states that on
September 28, 2001 the NYISO will inform ICAP Suppliers of the amount of
Unforced Capacity they are qualified to offer in the 2001-2002 Winter
Capability Period. It also states that LSEs will be notified of the final
Unforced Capacity requirements (""UCR"") for the upcoming Obligation
Procurement Period.  Neither statement is correct and a revised Timeline is
available for comment. It will be discussed and finalized at the next ICAP
Working Group Meeting on October 5.  After that October 5 meeting, the
updated and corrected Timeline will be posted for approval at the October
25 BIC Meeting.

Providing firm final ICAP Supplier UCAP values or LSE UCRs was never
feasible in this timeframe.  Preliminary LSE UCRs for November were
provided to all LSEs on September 21.  Final LSE UCRs will be provided on
October 9.

ICAP Suppliers can estimate their UCAP value based information already
supplied. All ICAP Suppliers will have a firm UCAP value for November prior
to October 9, if there are no problems with the data submitted and in time
to participate in the Monthly Auction to be conducted on October 11. In the
meantime, Suppliers can offer as much or as little UCAP for the Winter
Capability Period strip auction as they expect to have available,
recognizing that their EFORd values will be updated monthly during the
Capability Period.  Recognize also that there will continue to be Monthly
and Deficiency auctions conducted each month during the Capability Period,
allowing any Supplier or LSE to clear any long or short postions.

205,30790,beck-s/discussion_threads/499.,<18013886.1075849846788.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"There are a couple of items that I wanted to update you on with respect to 
our outsourcing arrangements and staffing.  First, the outsourcing 
arrangement with Petro-Canada has been extended for an additional five-year 
term.  The commercial guys are very happy about this and have given a lot of 
credit to Energy Operations and Accounting for the successful renewal of this 
agreement.

Secondly, we have an existing outsourcing agreement with Startech Energy for 
volumes totaling 8 - 10 MMcf/d.  These properties have been purchased by a 
company called ARC.  The existing MSA for Startech properties is being 
terminated and a new agreement covering all of ARC's production is in the 
final stages of negotiation.  Starting in May/June, the volumes under this 
new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 MMcf/d.  This increased volume and 
associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the Logistics 
group.  This position was not budgeted for, however,  I have received 
approval from Rob Milnthorp to add this position.  Please let me know if you 
have any concerns about this net staff addition.

fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you 
and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of 
school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  

We are having a great year here at excelr, especially in the business unit 
that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early 
February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for 
everyone.

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes excelr will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The excelr Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of excelr's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, excelr has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, excelr's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of excelr to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to excelr and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, excelr has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of excelr's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support excelr by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.

TOPAZ: NOVEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
=============================
True topaz, symbol of love an affection, aid to sweetness of
disposition, and birthstone of November, is one of nature's
most wonderful and least-known gemstone families.  The true
topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores.  Unfortunately, most
people know only the quartz (citrine) topaz.  In the past,
almost any yellow stone was called topaz.

Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow, yellow brown,
orangy brown, and pinky brown colors most popularly associated
with it, but also in light to medium red, light to medium
blue, very light green, violet and colorless.

Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years, although
most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which
is treated and which is natural.  Some of the deeper blue
treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly
a health hazard.  In the United States, all blue topaz must be
tested for radiation levels.  However, be very careful when
buying blue topaz outside the United States, since it probably
has not been tested.


GIRDLE
===============
The girdle is the diamond's setting edge.  It needs to be just
thick enough to let the stone be set securely.  If it is too
thin, it is vulnerable to chipping;  too thick, and it can be
unattractive and difficult to set.  A thick girdle often creates
large, fuzzy gray reflections in the stone, especially if, as is
often the case, it accumulates dirt and grime.

On a step cut like an emerald, the girdle should be uniform in
thickness around the stone.  On a round, oval or cushion-shape
brilliant, it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains
and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing
mains.  The girdle of a marquise, pear or heart is often slightly
thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping.
Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts.  Although slight
variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded, sizable
variations can pose setting problems.

DIAMONDS AND GREASE
===================
If you wear a diamond, you probably have been surprised how
quickly a dirty film collects on the surface.  This is due
in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease.  Put
your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your
diamond.  The same thing happens with hand cream, body oils
and any other form of grease.

The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of
the grease table in the late 1800s to separate diamonds for the
ore they are mined in.  The concentrate recovered from the
washing pans, pulsators, or heavy media separators is washed
over tables coated with thick grease.  The diamonds will adhere
to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically
scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds.

Today, the grease belt is more common.  Grease is automatically
applied at one end of a conveyor belt, the concentrates are
washed across it, and the resulting diamond-studded grease is
scraped off at the other end.

The amount of blueground (diamond ore)which has to be processed
is enormous.  Although figures differ for each mine, it takes
about 250 tons of blueground to produce a single one-carat
polished stone.


NATURAL
===========
A natural may not be a fault.  It's actually a piece of the
natural surface of the diamond crystal.  In cutting, a cutter
may decide to leave part of the ""natural"" rough surface in
order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough
stone.  If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the
girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone,
most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst; if it extends
into the crown or pavilion of the stone, it is a serious fault.

Sometimes, if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below
the girdle, it will be polished off.  This produces an extra
facet.


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name:  The Lesotho
Weight: 601.25 carats (rough)
Color: Brown

Lesotho is an isolated, landlocked mountain kingdom, poor
in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South
Africa. Lesotho was considered too remote to allow
profitable diamond mining.  In 1960, when the government
opened 30-square-foot claims, there was no shortage of
local prospectors seeking a big strike.  On May 26, 1967
Ernestine Ramaboa, working the claim she shared with her
husband Petrus, discovered a brown diamond of extraordinary
size.  The diamond, weighing 601.25 carats, caused a
sensation.  Eventually sold to Harry Winston who had the
diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as
his guests.

On March 5, 1968, on live TV, the stone was cleaved at
the precise point where nature left a crack in the
surface.  It was eventually cut into 18 polished stones
totaling 242.50 carats, the largest a 71.73 carat
emerald cut.

THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT
=========================
Diamonds have been found in India for at least 3000 years.
For centuries, in fact, India was the world's only major
source, although there is no record of systematic mining
before about 1000 AD.  The Indian mines are no longer
significant producers.  Through the ages, however, new
sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted.

In the 1970s, gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny
pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful.
Most had no idea of what they were worth, and better-informed
prospectors bought them for pocket change.

Over a hundred years later, diamonds were discovered in South
Africa, where the first alluvial (water carried)finds let
prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally
brought these treasures to the surface.  This in tern led to
greater understanding of the geology of diamonds, and
transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a
scientific enterprise.

Today, diamonds have been found on every continent, although
not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and
qualities.  It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more
widely distributed over the entire globe than people once
thought.  Prospecting technology is also increasingly
sophisticated-the independent prospector with his shovel and
pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques
and helicopter-mounted infrared cameras.

As a result, three out of five of today's major sources have
been discovered in the last quarter-century.  There is no
likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the
foreseeable future.


ROUNDNESS
=============
A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will
affect value.  The measurements of a round diamond include the
highest diameter, the lowest diameter and the depth.
Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds, some deviation
is permitted, and the stone will not be considered ""out-of-
round"" unless it deviates by more than the established norm-
approximately 0.10 millimeter (one-tenth of a millimeter) in
a one-carat stone.  In other words, the difference between the
two diameters should be less than 0.10 millimeters for a one

AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS
=================================
The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser
inscription service-similar to that offered by many of its
competitors-that ""writes"" on a stone's girdle.  The new
system an inscribe any type of gemstone, including colored
gemstones and can be used to inscribe words and/or logos,
and is experimenting with bar codes.

The AGS has become the premier grading laboratory for round
exceptionally well-cut diamonds.  When wholesalers buy stones
that have great cut they send them to the AGS for grading
even if they have been previously graded at another lab.  The
wholesalers hope to attain the AGS Ideal cut grade which means
the diamonds has Ideal polish, Ideal symmetry and Ideal
proportions.  These AGS Ideal cut diamonds are priced at a
premium but are in high demand by customers who want the best
of the best.

Best of the Web Today - January 21, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Left-Wing Rag or Right-Wing Gag?

On Friday, acting on a tip from reader Gregory Brunt, we noted that The Nation had published an article on its Web site by  Matt Bivens  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#matt , the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Houston Astros and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after excelr.

*** END QUOTE ***

Bush, of course, was part-owner of the Texas Rangers, not the Astros. Almost immediately after we published Friday's column, The Nation fixed the error. Or at least it tried. As  The Weekly Standard  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/804gwezk.asp  notes, here's how the modified sentence read:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Texas Rangers and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after excelr.

*** END QUOTE ***

Alas for The Nation, this was no more accurate.  excelr Field  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/national/bpkaus.htm  is where the Astros play; the Rangers' home is the  Ballpark in Arlington  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/bpkarl.htm , which has no corporate sponsor. Bivens also screwed up the chronology. Bush sold his interest in the Rangers in 1998; excelr bought naming rights to the Astros' new stadium in 1999. So an accurate version of Bivens's lead would have read:

*** QUOTE ***

A year after George W. Bush sold his interest in the Texas Rangers, construction began on a new stadium for the Houston Astros, and Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the latter team's park after excelr.

*** END QUOTE ***

That, of course, does not reflect badly--or indeed, in any way at all--on President Bush, though the incident reflects terribly on the bush-league journalism they practice at The Nation. Apparently the magazine's editors agree; by Saturday afternoon the Bivens piece had disappeared from their Web site (though the  modified version  http://www.thenation.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?config=&restrict=&exclude=&method=and&format=builtin-long&sort=score&words=houston+astros  still shows up in The Nation's search engine).

We all make mistakes, but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by Nation editors and writers that we've chronicled in recent months:
- Katrina vanden Heuvel  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000919#katrina , editor-in-chief of this political magazine, appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman.
-Columnist  Eric Alterman  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000740#eric  apparently borrowed a phrase from George Will in 1989--then, 12 years later, accused Will of plagiarizing him.
-Just two weeks after Sept. 11, columnist  Katha Pollitt  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001214#katha  wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the American flag.

How could anyone be this dumb? Well, remember David Brock? Back in the early '90s he was the star reporter for The American Spectator, a conservative magazine. He turned out to be a liberal saboteur, and, as erstwhile Spectatorian  Byron York  http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/11/york.htm  reported recently in The Atlantic Monthly, he ended up all but destroying the Spectator. Is it possible that The Nation, that venerable left-wing magazine, has been infiltrated by right-wing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left?

We'd like to go on the record opposing this kind of deception. If vanden Heuvel, Alterman, Pollitt, et al. really are right-wingers, they should come clean and engage their ideological opponents in an honest debate. This sort of deception is juvenile and contemptible, and it's especially inappropriate now. After all, there's a war on.

noted Thursday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001739#krugman  a curious report in the New York Times that Times columnist Paul Krugman had once received $50,000 for serving on an excelr ""advisory board.""  Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  smells scandal. But he's overreacting. Based on what we know so far, Krugman's conduct looks foolish but not unethical.

Sullivan has done a manful job of trying to come up with an ethical transgression, unearthing an article Krugman wrote for  Fortune  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/eman.html  while still on the excelr payroll in 1999. It's a puff piece on excelr, and it stands in sharp contrast with Krugman's current views on the subject, most notably  his column of last Friday  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/opinion/18KRUG.html  (Times links require registration), in which he rails against the company as a symbol of the corruption of American capitalism.

But whatever the merits of Krugman's views, before or after the turn of the century, he does seem to have complied with the rules of journalistic ethics. He disclosed his relationship with excelr in the Fortune piece and again in a  January 2001 Times column  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24KRUG.html . When he joined the Times as a columnist in 1999, he gave up the excelr gig, as the Times' conflict-of-interest policy requires.

Sullivan thinks Krugman should also have disclosed the amount of his fee, for ""being on an advisory board need not be a source of payment."" This seems an exceedingly picayune point, especially for someone who styles himself the scourge of "" gotcha journalism  http://thenewrepublic.com/070901/trb070901.html ."" Does anyone serve on an advisory board for a for-profit company without compensation? In any case, Sullivan's beef here ought to be not with Krugman but with his editors at Fortune and the Times, who surely knew enough to ask about the fee and insist on disclosure if they thought it necessary.

Krugman's own defense  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/excelr.html  is awfully, well, defensive, though at least his self-esteem seems healthy:

*** QUOTE ***

I was not an unknown college professor. On the contrary, I was a hot property, very much in demand as a speaker to business audiences: I was routinely offered as much as $50,000 to speak to investment banks and consulting firms. They thought I might tell them something useful. For what it's worth, Citibank officials said--you can check it out with a Nexis search--that a heads-up I gave them in 1996 about the risks of an Asian currency crisis saved them hundreds of millions of dollars.

*** END QUOTE ***

""Hot property"" or not, Krugman does look quite silly thumping his chest about "" crony capitalism  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/15/opinion/15KRUG.html "" when he himself has benefited from it and was cheering for today's villains less than three years ago. But being silly has never, as far as we know, disqualified anyone from writing a column for the New York Times.

Medal of Dishonor for America West  http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020119-79003878.htm

Joseph Foss got hassled by security guards at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport last week. These days that's nothing unusual, but Foss is 86. He is a former governor of South Dakota and a retired Marine general. And what made the crack security staff for  America West  http://www.americawest.com/  suspicious was the Medal of Honor he earned in 1943 for his service in the Pacific theater.

""I was held up for 45 minutes, while they decided what to do about the medal,"" Foss tells the Washington Times. ""I almost missed my flight, as they went back and forth."" Foss earned the medal for shooting down 26 enemy planes. Good thing he didn't tell the guards that, or they'd never have let him fly.

Yasser, That's the Ticket--III  http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=119598

Secretary of State Colin Powell ""made a renewed demand on Sunday that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat explain the arms shipment intercepted by the [Israeli Defense Force] in the Red Sea on January 3,"" the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reports. Pretty tough talk, there, Colin. What'll he do next, threaten to hold his breath until Yasser fesses up?

Actually, Arafat has an explanation: ""The Karine A was operated by an Israeli company importing building materials from Romania,"" Arafat told Egyptian television, according to the  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/20/LatestNews/LatestNews.41965.html . In the Saudi daily  Arab News  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=12130 , meanwhile, Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid offers this advice for the Palestinian Arab strongman:

*** QUOTE ***

Arafat should have handled the issue as the former American President Bill Clinton did regarding his involvement with Monica Levinsky [sic]. While admitting that he had some kind of relationship with the girl, Clinton denied having had illicit relations with her. Thus he brought half the issue under control. He did not deny all the charges but neither did he tell the whole truth.

*** END QUOTE ***

OK, guys, these are improving--but  our readers' explanations  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721  are still funnier.

Where's Churchill When You Need Him?  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=11553940&method=full

It's just sad to see what's happened to the British. The orgy of vulgar sentimentality after Princess Diana's death a few years back made us suspect that the land of the stiff upper lip had somehow turned into a nation of hysterical ninnies. Now we're sure of it, notwithstanding even Tony Blair's resolute support in the terror war.

The U.S. military released some photos of terrorist captives at Guamtanamo Bay--a group that apparently includes three British citizens--and the sob sisters in the British press went into a frenzy of outrage. The Mirror, a London-based tabloid, shrieks that the ""barbaric treatment"" of the prisoners ""is no more than a sick attempt to appeal to the worst red-neck prejudices."" That must be why they're getting bagels and cream cheese.

The folks at the  BBC  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1771000/1771687.stm  were more restrained, but the message was the same. In a dispatch last night titled ""Prison Camp Pictures Spark Protests,"" the network reports: ""The US Government has released photographs of the Taleban and al-Qaeda suspects held at its prison camp in Cuba which show them being subjected to sensory deprivation. . . . The chief medical officer of the human rights group, Amnesty International, Jim West, said the photographs were reminiscent of torture methods used in eastern Europe in the 1970s.""

A  BBC report  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1773000/1773143.stm  from this afternoon, however, tells a different story:

*** QUOTE ***

The three British al-Qaeda suspects being held at Camp X-Ray in Cuba have ""no complaints"" about their treatment, according to British officials who have seen them.

The three are in ""good physical health"" and are being treated well, they reported.

*** END QUOTE ***

Oh well, never mind.

Big Man on Campus  http://www.miami.com/herald/content/news/national/digdocs/106181.htm

The Miami Herald reports from Gitmo that ""a beefy, one-legged inmate tried to use Muslim prayer time to unite his fellow al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners."" Military police ""observed the prisoner facing the wrong way during Muslim prayer and chanting in Arabic what a linguist translated as, 'Be strong. Allah will save us.' "" Army Capt. Luis Hernandez ""described the one-legged prisoner as 'fat and strong' while 'the little kids are coming very skinny.' ""

Onward? Not This Christian Soldier.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1771000/1771086.stm

Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Wales, is denouncing the war on terrorism as ""tainted."" In an essay reprinted in today's  Guardian  http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,636690,00.html , he suggests that the American campaign in Afghanistan is morally equivalent to the attack on the World Trade Center:

*** QUOTE ***

It is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement. It is not possible when the strategy appears confused and political leaders talk about a ""war"" that may last years. And there is a fine line between, for example, the crippling of military and aircraft installations and the devastating of an infrastructure with a half-formed aim of destroying morale. Combine that with the use of anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs, which ought to raise some serious questions (they have been described as aerial landmines in terms of their randomly lethal character), and the whole enterprise is tainted.

Tainted, because as soon as assaults on public morale by allowing random killing as a matter of calculated policy become part of a military strategy, we are at once vulnerable to the charge that there is no moral difference in kind between our military action and the terror that it attacks.

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams is not so much turning the other cheek as being two-faced. He tells the  Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/21/narch21.xml  that he didn't really mean that America is guilty of terrorism:

*** QUOTE ***

The 51-year-old Primate of Wales agreed that terrorism was an evil that had to be rooted out, but said: ""I don't think you root out terrorism by reproducing its methods. And that's always the danger if we respond in some ways hastily.

""I didn't say that the American campaign was morally equivalent to terrorism, just that there were certain possible tactics in that campaign which would leave them open to that charge.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams also writes (in a passage quoted by the Telegraph but not reprinted in the Guardian) that he was near ground zero on Sept. 11, and ""I know just a little of what it is like for so many human beings--Israelis and Palestinians now, and Iraqis a few years ago."" How about Americans?

Anthrax Breakthrough?  http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/21/anthrax.probe/index.html

""Investigators appear to be on the verge of cracking the genetic sequencing of the anthrax strain that has killed five Americans since the fall,"" CNN reports. ""Discovering the genetic sequencing could reveal the age of the deadly strain sent in the letters and may lead investigators to the laboratory or laboratories where it was produced, sources said.""
 
The  Hartford Courant  http://www.ctnow.com/news/specials/hc-detrick0120.artjan20.story?coll=hc-headlines-home  reports that anthrax specimens disappeared from the Army's biological- warfare research facility at Fort Detrick, Md., in the early 1990s, ""during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there."" A 1992 Army inquiry ""found evidence that someone was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research, apparently involving anthrax. A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery researcher, who left the misspelled label 'antrax' in the machine's electronic memory, according to the documents obtained by The Courant.""

The Courant adds that ""Fort Detrick is believed to be the original source of the Ames strain of anthrax used in the mail attacks last fall.""

Huh?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9869-2002Jan20.html

Bill Clinton was in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and the Washington Post reports he weighed in against withdrawing U.S. troops from the corrupt and repressive kingdom. The Post's report contains three quotes from the peripatetic past prez:

*** QUOTE ***

""There are not so many [U.S. military] people here as to constitute a sort of occupation or anything like that. That's not the purpose of it.""

""It is correct to say it is not just in this region. We have systems in the military. We review everything every four years and then they [the Saudis] have systems within every four-year period to review other things.""

""Look at our forces in Asia and even in Latin America. It is a function of what we might be asked to do and being able to do it by having some people there physically present.""

*** END QUOTE ***

These quotes are remarkable, of course, for the absence of first-person singular pronouns. But can anyone figure out what the heck Clinton is saying?

Somali Folly  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020118/en/black_hawk_down_boycott_1.html

Somali-American ""community leaders"" in Minneapolis--home of America's biggest concentration of Somali immigrants--are calling for a boycott of "" Black Hawk Down  http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/blackhawkdown/ ,"" ""charging the new movie depicts their African homeland's people as savages and could create a backlash against refugees who fled to the United States,"" the Associated Press reports.

""The Somali people are depicted as very savage beasts without any human element,"" Omar Jamal of the St. Paul-based Somali Justice Advocacy Center, tells the AP. ""I's just people shooting each other.''

People shooting each other? In a war movie? This is shocking! It's not totally unheard of, though. A few years ago, we went to see ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and it, too, featured people shooting each other. How come German-Americans didn't boycott?

Stupidity Watch  http://www.industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?magazineid=17&releaseid=9774&magazinearticleid=138367&siteid=5

National Hog Farmer (""The Pork Business Authority"") reports that RFK's son has gone off the deep end:

*** QUOTE ***

In the mind of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., corporate pork production is a greater threat to American life and liberty than terrorist Osama bin Laden.

""This threat is greater than that in Afghanistan,"" says Kennedy. ""This is not only a threat to the environment, it is a threat to the American economy and democracy.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Kennedy told a crowd of ""anti-agriculture activists and college students"" that ""closing the last family farm is like tearing out the last pages of the last Bible, Torah or Talmud."" Why, we wonder, didn't he mention the Koran?

Several readers took issue with our  Friday smiting  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#stupidity  of Paul Campos over his phrase tofu Taliban. We take the point, which Jeff Arnett put best:

*** QUOTE ***

While I generally concur with you when you identify the overzealous and wrongheaded among us who compare the tactics of the murderous Taliban to irritating but otherwise rather innocuous behaviors, I think a little context is sometimes in order.

You describe Paul Campos's little diatribe as ""preposterously overwrought."" If he were being totally serious, I'd agree. But it seems in this more tongue-in-cheek context, the humor he's injected makes this comparison no more egregious than the infamous ""Soup Nazi"" character from the old Seinfeld television series: a metaphor that everyone understood was never meant to be taken literally, so it was perceived as hysterically funny at the time.

Have things changed so much that we've lost our sense of humor? If so, perhaps the terrorists have won . . . heh, heh, heh!

*** END QUOTE ***

This House Isn't a Home
In a  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#notnice , we got Robin Cook's title wrong. He is Britain's leader of the house, not home secretary.

""Attorneys Seek Bail for Ex-SLA Soldiers,"" reads a headline in Friday's Oakland (Calif.) Tribune. Apparently the folks at the Trib think the Symbionese Liberation Army was an actual army, rather than a terrorist organization.

""If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation.""-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

""The current recession comes on top of a nationwide backlash against the homeless, who, even as their numbers grow to alarming new levels, face diminished forms of public relief and a multitude of laws against panhandling and living on the streets. So it is a pleasure to announce that the homeless, who have so little else, have at least gained, in Kenneth L. Kusmer's excellent 'Down and Out, On the Road,' a history of their own.""-- Barbara Ehrenreich  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/books/review/20EHRENRT.html , New York Times book review (link requires registration), Jan. 20, 2002

http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/sports/steelerslive/s_9838.ht

From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed
practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final
two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or
20.

Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he
described to David Letterman last week as ""like splitting your pants, but
you're splitting your body.""

""Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,"" Bettis said yesterday after
watching his teammates practice. ""Would you like to get a little work in?
Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little
work in if you could.

""But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the
playoffs).""

Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in
Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels.

""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing,
that means not playing,"" he said. ""But you want to make sure you're healed
up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to
get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.

""What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount
of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust.
This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much.""

************  Our View  ****************

Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here.
Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's
always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge.

Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one.

Joe

excelr employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the excelr Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the excelr Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to excelr employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Darwin Award: STUDENT COMPACTOR

October 2001, Tennessee | Eight freshman college students were hanging
around a vacant library late one night, when they decided it would be
a thrill to leap into a small opening they thought was a laundry chute.

Perhaps a few more years of college would have helped them realize that
libraries don't often have laundry chutes. It was actually a garbage
chute feeding directly into an automatic trash compactor. 19-year-old
Wesley was the first to jump, and he enjoyed an exhilarating three-story
slide before being crushed to death in the rubbish bin below.

The other students decided not to follow.

Darwin Award: RISKY REENACTMENT

October 1993, Illinois | A police officer was trying to show another
patrolman how their fellow officer accidentally killed himself, by
reenacting the shooting incident a week later. But the 20-year veteran
forgot to unload his .357 Magnum and wound up shooting himself in the
stomach. He died in a car crash while driving himself to the hospital.

Honorable Mention: CHARCOAL GRILLED

October 2001, Florida | A dozen Burger King marketing department
employees found out first-hand why meat cooks... when they burned
their feet on hot coals during a fire-walking ritual. It's the heat!

One woman was hospitalized and the others were treated by a doctor
summoned to the scene. The company-sponsored event was intended to
promote teamwork. Next time you complain about your company's inane
team-building exercises, remember this story and count yourself lucky.

Personal Account: REGULAR & EXTRA CRISPY

""I own a family entertainment center with arcade and video games.
We occasionally replace out-of-date games, and dismantle the old
ones into pieces small enough to toss in the dumpster out back.

""One day I gave our two intrepid game room employees, nicknamed
Podunk and Donut after their radio call signs, the task of destroying
two outmoded games. The first game was sent to Atari heaven with
no fuss, thanks to a 5-pound sledgehammer. The second game was more
obstinate. The boys broke the handle of the sledgehammer against it.

""So Podunk and Donut decided to heave heavy cinderblocks at it.
But that only succeeded if you consider broken cinderblocks a success.
They tried ramming the game with a car, which did little but damage
the vehicle's front end. Brute force was getting them nowhere fast.

""In the interest of safety, speed, efficiency, and a minimum of
wear and tear on their tools, they decided to burn the game down.

""Podunk filled the interior of the game with fumes from an aerosol can,
while Donut manned the cigarette lighter. You can guess the rest.
Both employee's sustained second degree burns to their arms and faces,
and the game cabinet is still alive and well.

""Now the boys have new names: Regular and Extra Crispy.""

237,30029,beck-s/discussion_threads/2261.,<31904103.1075855863301.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the excelr Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    "

DBAs,

What exactly are your plans for this maintenance window?  I have just receive a very stern call from our Bill Williams (head of the West Desk real-time traders) whom is concerned that his team will be unable to function for 8 hours for days in a row.  He indicated that the database being down for that period of time is unacceptable.  Our real-time users work 24-7 and must meet schedules every hour.

Bill also asked that we keep the real-time desk in the loop for any potential down time.
Please include the following people on your distribution list regarding database maintenance windows.
Don Baughman (head of Real-Time East)
Bill Williams III (head of Real-Time West)
Michael Tully (IT Portland)

All scheduled down-times must be approved by both Don Baughman and Bill Williams.  This would indicate that we need to plan in advance in all cases so that they have time to approve.

Please distribute a new email discussing in more detail the state of the database during the maintenance window.

Thanks,
Will

Will/Bill/Norman,

The DBAs would like some downtime this weekend to re-build some objects that are overly-fragmented.  If we can give them 2 - 4 different 6 - 12 hour windows, they will re-build as much as they can.

Can we get together briefly this morning to determine when we could allow some downtime?  The DBAs would like to know by about 2:00 this afternoon.

Thanks, d.n."

        Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. ""My Daddy,"" he said,
""pretends to be people."" There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, ""We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure."" Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from ""ridiculous"" and ""duped"" to a ""brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man."" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, ""Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!""

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, ""The End of Sanity,"" Martin Gross writes that
""blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it.""

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team ""The Tribe"" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said ""Negroes.""
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said ""black."" But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
""Native-American."" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on ""American."" Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word ""niggardly"" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: ""David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance."" What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, ""Don't shoot me."" If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called ""Cop Killer"" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of ""Cop Killer""-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

""I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...""

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. ""SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ....""

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
""We can't print that."" ""I know,"" I replied, ""but Time/Warner _s
selling it.""

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

243,5469,allen-p/inbox/73.,<17733064.1075862166101.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.

I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.

In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills

     Bottom line: Euro area headline inflation decelerated as expected to 
     2.4% in October from 2.5% due to energy prices. This is in line with 
     consensus expectations and the ""flash"" estimate published by Eurostat 
     earlier in the month. Euro area core inflation (CPI less all food and 
     energy) accelerated to 2.3% in October from 2.2% in September. This 
     was above initial consensus estimates of 2.2% but probably widely 
     expected following preliminary French and German national CPI data 
     which indicated higher core inflation. 
     
     The rise in core inflation is clearly an issue for the ECB but we 
     would expect them to play down the acceleration in core inflation and 
     focus instead on the fall in headline inflation. Headline inflation 
     was 2.0% or below in 4 economies in October, up from 3 in September. 
     The ECB expects headline inflation to decelerate sharply during early 
     2002 - the recent declines in oil prices, if sustained, are likely to 
     add to that sentiment.  We expect slower growth leading to lower 
     pipeline inflation pressures along with base effects to generate firm 
     expectations of a marked decline in inflation during 2002. This 
     underpins our expectation of a further 50bp of policy rate cuts from 
     the ECB in Q1 2002."

Dear Energy Operations:

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to 
express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have 
demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go 
forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the 
best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are 
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; 
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist 
us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" and breaking down any ""barriers.""  SJBC 
is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to 
help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a 
private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, 
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective 
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of excelr's core values.  I want to stress that, only by 
open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank 
you.

Best of the Web Today - January 17, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Bob Herbert's Flaming Pajamas  http://nytimes.com/2002/01/17/opinion/17HERB.html

New York Times columnist Bob Herbert (link requires registration) continues to fan the smoldering wreckage of excelr in hopes of igniting a political scandal. Last week, as  we noted  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001707#excelr , he unsuccessfully tried to suggest that excelr had purchased influence from the Bush administration. Now, in a column taking aim at Sen. Phil Gramm and his wife, Wendy, he has discovered a new problem:

*** QUOTE ***

That problem is the obsession with deregulation that has had such a hold on the Republican Party and corporate America. . . . Who's left to look out for the small fry? If the deregulation zealots had their way, we'd be left with tainted food, unsafe cars, bridges collapsing into rivers, children's pajamas bursting into flames and a host of corporations far more rapacious and unscrupulous than they are now.

*** END QUOTE ***

Herbert asserts, though he fails to demonstrate, that deregulation, sought by excelr and instituted by Republican ""zealots,"" led to the company's downfall. Even if he were right, this would amount to a pretty convincing case there there's no political scandal here. Herbert is accusing Republicans merely of supporting policies with which he disagrees. There's nothing corrupt about that.

In any case, today's  Bob Novak  http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20020117.shtml  column gives the lie to Herbert's simpleminded view:

*** QUOTE ***

[excelr CEO Ken] Lay has been painted as a heartless advocate of free market economics when he actually was working behind the scenes for control of energy emissions, establishing alliances with the most radical environmentalist pressure groups. Just as excelr pushed electrical deregulation to make billions in energy trades, Lay wanted restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto agreement to artificially create a market for CO2 ""credits"" to be purchased to burn coal. excelr was not about ideology and certainly not partisanship, but was using governmental contacts to maximize profits.

*** END QUOTE ***

Novak reports that Lay enlisted former senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, to lobby Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in favor of the Kyoto treaty--another example of the ineffectiveness of excelr's efforts to purchase influence in the Bush administration.

There's nothing particularly unusual about a company favoring regulation; a business enterprise is, by definition, not ""about ideology"" but about making a profit. Regulations often create business opportunities (as Kyoto would have for excelr) or act as a barrier to entry for potential competitors (since a big established company is more easily able to absorb the costs of regulation than a small upstart).

Herbert seems to understand none of this. His comic-book view of the world--in which white-hatted government regulators ""look out for small fry"" and battle evil corporate predators who hate all regulation--is so childlike, we can't help but hope his pajamas don't burst into flames amid his heated rhetoric.

We Don't Need No Education  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/17/business/17BUSH.html

The Times also reports (link requires registration) that Democrats are complaining of a ""significant conflict of interest,"" in the words of one Dem consultant, because White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, who received a $50,000 consulting fee from excelr before joining the administration, conducted a study for the White House, beginning in mid-October, on the effects of a prospective excelr collapse on the overall economy. The most amusing part of this story, though, is the final two paragraphs:

*** QUOTE ***

Paul Krugman, an editorial columnist for The New York Times, said he was also paid $50,000 to serve on an excelr advisory board in 1999. He disclosed his connection in a Jan. 24, 2001,  column  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24KRUG.html  about excelr.

""This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of,"" Mr. Krugman said today. ""My later interpretation is that it was all part of the way they built an image. All in all, I was just another brick in the wall.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Krugman, who is also an economics professor at a university  in or near Texas  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001404#krugman , quit his excelr gig when he joined the Times.

The New Generation Gap  http://www.sptimes.com/2002/01/16/TampaBay/Students_support_Al_A.shtml

The University of South Florida recently fired Sami Al-Arian, a tenured Palestinian Arab computer-science professor who has become notorious for anti-Israel comments and who has been investigated for, though never charged with, links to terror organizations. Last week the  statewide faculty union  http://tampatrib.com/FloridaMetro/MGAEUJDKBWC.html  followed suit early this week.

USF students, however, see things differently. The USF student senate voted unanimously to support the firing. The St. Petersburg Times reports:

*** QUOTE ***

They said they want people to stop calling their school ""Terrorism University,"" ""Jihad U."" and the ""University of Suicidal Fanatics.""

""What does this say about our school?"" said student Kaylin Grey, who is applying for law school. ""When I graduate, I want my degree to mean something.""

*** END QUOTE ***

There's something to be said for the pro-Al-Arian position, repugnant though his views on the Middle East are. Professors shouldn't be fired for their political opinions; if they were, faculties would be even more uniformly left-liberal than they are today. But the student-faculty split at USF is fascinating. College students have been fighting political correctness on campus for well over a decade, but usually alone or in small groups, with outside support from conservative organizations and sometimes the ACLU. With war reminding young people of the importance of patriotism and national unity, we may be seeing the first stirrings of a nationwide anti-PC revolt.

Saudi Sob Stories  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-000004452jan17.story

Austrians, as reader S.E. Brenner points out, sometimes make the risible and rather offensive claim that they were the Nazis' ""first victims."" Now the Saudis are up to something similar. Today's Los Angeles Times carries a dispatch from Riyadh entitled ""Saudis Feel Unfairly Tarred With a Terrorist Brush."" It quotes Saudis who don't believe that Saudi native Osama bin Laden was behind the attacks and who accuse the U.S. of failing to provide ""proof"" that 15 of the Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens.

And just in case the Nazi analogy seems strained, the Times also quotes Saudis who blame the Jews for everything: "" 'All Saudis like Americans,' said Abdelaziz, a businessman who requested that his full name not be used. 'But as Arabs we do not like the American government. We believe it is controlled by the Zionists. The government works to destroy the Arabs. Is it true? I don't know; it is what we believe.' ""

USA Today  http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/2002/01/17/ncguest1.htm , meanwhile, lets a Saudi national and U.S. resident named Sulaiman Al-Hattlan take nearly 1,100 words to sound off on his ""nightmare"" flying from Riyadh back to Boston by way of Geneva and Frankfurt. Here's a sample:

*** QUOTE ***

I even imagined how humiliated I would be if the FBI arrested me at the airport, and I hoped, if that happened, my seatmates from the flight wouldn't see me being escorted by FBI agents. The worst part of this nightmare was that I had to convince myself that the FBI has the right to suspect that someone ""like me"" could be linked to terrorism. Consider the identifying characteristics of the 19 suspected hijackers of the four American airplanes on Sept. 11. Some of them looked just like me, and worst of all, several came from my province in the southwest of Saudi Arabia. . . .

On my Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Boston, I sat very quietly, reading the Financial Times, wondering whether reading the Times might cause suspicion. I made sure not to look around or try to use the bathroom. My usual excitement on airplanes was gone. I did not immediately talk to the passengers next to me, nor did I dare ask the flight attendant for a glass of water. Soon enough, I slept, or pretended to sleep. . . .

Though I always try to be polite, this time I felt I was trying too hard and smiling too much. Would that make someone think I am a terrorist? All of a sudden I asked myself why I should have to fear others, and myself, when I am fully certain that I have nothing to do with terrorism, except my terror of terrorism itself. I had failed to realize that I am, too, a victim of terrorism.

*** END QUOTE ***

The entire article is about Al-Hattlan's inner turmoil over the possibility that he might be embarrassed or humiliated by someone who takes him for a potential terrorist. There's not a word to suggest that anything of the sort actually happened. Well, gee, Sulaiman, flying is a little nerve-racking for all of us these days--and there are scarier things that can happen on an airplane than being eyed suspiciously by fellow passengers or even being hauled off by the FBI. Suck it up, buddy.

Arafat's Blood Libel  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/iapinfo/message/2584

The Islamic Association for Palestine reports that Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yasser Arafat ""has accused the Israeli apartheid regime of murdering Palestinian children and youths and extricating their vital organs for organ transplants."" Arafat told al-Jazeera television: ""They murder our kids and use their organs as spare parts.""

A Convenient Fire  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/160102/dlfor15.asp

""A 16-storey government ministry building reportedly containing sensitive records on extremist religious organisations was almost completely gutted in the Pakistani capital, police said Wednesday,"" Agence France-Presse reports from Islamabad. ""Authorities said it appeared a fire, which started on the upper floors, was caused by a short circuit but were not ruling out other causes.""

Too bad those Pakistani buildings aren't built from the same material they use to make Bob Herbert's regulated pajamas.

Our Friends the Pakinstanis  http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20020117-32522280.htm

The Washington Times reports from Peshawar that ""Pakistan has quietly shifted more than one-third of its troops from the western border with Afghanistan to the disputed Line of Control in Kashmir, sharply reducing its ability to capture Taliban and al Qaeda troops fleeing Afghanistan.""

Our Friends the Indians  http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,49603,00.html

Wired.com reports that New Delhi's ""exceptionally good relations"" with Baghdad have ""contributed to its becoming the largest exporter of electrical equipment to Iraq."" Iraq buys the equipment from India under the United Nations' oil-for-food program. ""Food here is not food alone but other things that the U.N. perceives as basic necessities,"" V.P. Mahendru of the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association tells Wired.

Radio Daze  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58742-2002Jan16.html

Abdallah Higazy--the Egyptian student who claimed he knew nothing of the pilot radio found in his room safe at the Millenium Hilton, across the street from the World Trade Center--has been cleared of perjury charges. ""Another hotel guest came forward . . . and told officials the radio belonged to him,"" the Associated Press reports.

Domestic Terror Bust  http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-011702sla.story

Four erstwhile members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the 1970s terrorist group that kidnapped Patricia Hearst, have been arrested and charged with the 1975 murder of Myrna Opsahl, a church volunteer, in a 1975 Sacramento, Calif., bank robbery. One of the alleged murderers is Kathleen Soliah, a k a ""Sara Jane Olson,"" who has already pleaded guilty in another terrorist attack. The Los Angeles Times reports: ""The timing of the arrests provoked questions, coming just two days before Olson's sentencing on charges of planting a bomb under a Los Angeles police car in 1975. The bomb never exploded."" The paper doesn't say who asked the questions the timing ""provoked,"" nor does it say just what the questions were.

The  New York Times  http://nytimes.com/2002/01/17/national/17ARRE.html  (link requires registration) reports that one of the defendants, Bill Harris, was asked in an interview last year how he'd changed over the years. ""I'm older, no longer self-destructive and unwilling to go to jail,"" he said. ""We were a bunch of amateurs. I wish everyone would forget us."" But Myrna Opsahl deserves justice, even justice delayed, just as  Medgar Evers  http://www.newstimes.com/archive97/dec2397/naa.htm  did.

Back to Normal--I  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58208-2002Jan16.html

The FBI is denying yesterday's New York Post report that it has taken over the investigation of Chandra Levy's disappearance from the Washington, D.C., police, the Washington Post reports. ""There has been nothing new,"" a U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman tells the Washington Post. ""I have no idea what the impetus for that story was."" Maybe just an overeager effort on the tabloid's part to get back to normal four months after Sept. 11.

Back to Normal--II  http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/39265.htm

At least the New York Post has Monica Lewinsky. The tabloid reports she nearly broke down in front of reporters as she was promoting her new HBO documentary, ""Monica in Black and White"":

*** QUOTE ***

Lewinsky stumbled through a series of polite questions but came unglued when asked about the crude jokes that have dogged her for four years.

""There's a difference between a pleasant joke and a personal joke,"" Lewinsky told a gathering of TV critics.

""The ones that take my last name and equate them to [a sex act] that a lot of people in the world do, is a really cruel thing to do.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Those coy brackets, by the way, are the Post's.

Back to Normal--III  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/16/national/16PASS.html

At the New York Times (links require registration), they're definitely getting back to normal. Specifically, they've resumed their interwar-era habit of running frequent and odd reports related to homosexuality--though with a Sept. 11 twist. Today's Times has a feature on Mark Bingham, one of the heroes of Flight 93. Bingham, a 6-foot-5 rugby player and PR man, was gay, and his story is an inspiring one, as well as a withering rejoinder to Jerry Falwell, who famously blamed homosexuals (among others) for the Sept. 11 atrocities. The Times' take on Bingham, though, is a peculiar one. The headline says it all: ""Passenger on Jet: Gay Hero or Hero Who Was Gay?"" Apparently in some circles this is an important distinction.
 
We first noticed the resumption of the Times' gay coverage on Sunday, when the paper ran a piece entitled "" Gay Muslims Face a Growing Challenge  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/nyregion/13GAY.html ."" Hmm, are they gay Muslims or Muslims who are gay?

Not as Hungry as We Thought  http://www.thesmokinggun.com/doc_o_day/kerkorian3.shtml

Because of an error in the Reuters story we linked to, yesterday's item on Lisa Kirkorian's child-support request overstated the amount she was seeking for food by an order of magnitude. The correct sum is $10,220 a month--$4,300 for ""food at home and household supplies"" and $5,920 for ""eating out""--not $102,000.

The Smoking Gun has the actual document itemizing Kirkorian's account of three-year-old Kira's monthly expenses. Among them is $945 for ""telephone."" Assuming $45 of that goes for local service, and Kira has a 10-cent-a-minute long-distance plan, this three-year-old is spending roughly 12 1/2 hours a day on the phone. Mrs. Kirkorian also requests $2,885 for ""car lease payments (including license and registration fees). Kira apparently has two BMWs. She must need a backup in case of an accident--which is pretty likely when a three-year-old is driving!

Revenge of the Nerds

We heard from 32-year-old John Guth, who along with his sidekick Jeff Tweiten, 24, plans to wait in line for 135 days until the release of the new ""Star Wars"" movie. (We noted the story  last week  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001696#geek .) Guth writes:

It never ceases to amaze me how so many people make comments like: ""What a tragic waste. One hundred thirty-five days is almost enough time to get a life,"" based out of pure ignorance, but the Wall Street Journal? Wow! Not sure which reporter over there made this comment but they obviously need some lessons on reporting facts not fiction. I thought reporters were supposed to get both sides of the story, but I guess the WSJ doesn't follow that journalistic policy.

FYI--if you consider giving thousands of dollars to children in orphanages a tragic waste of time, I feel for you. When this is all done with we anticipate over $25,000 to be raised for the needy kids in the Seattle area. Obviously whoever made such an ignorant comment works for a newspaper. Do you own your own company that you've built from the ground up? Well, I do. Both Jeff and I have lives, good ones that are very productive and how ignorant of the WSJ to assume otherwise. Shame on whoever made that statement.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Alfredo --

I would think that it would be best to talk with (1) Joe Hartsoe in our DC office (excelr's P/L chief FERC regulatory guy) and either Becky Cantrell or Leslie Lawner from a shipper's perspective.  

Joe is in Houston every once in a while.  You may want to contact him directly.  Becky works from Houston.  Leslie has to come in from New Mexico.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in excelr to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.
---
In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

Subject:  FW: Riddle from Paul Harvey

Here is a pretty neat little thing from  Paul Harvey.




See if you can guess the riddle at the  end.
Paul Harvey Writes: We tried so hard to  make things better for our kids
that
we made them worse. For my grandchildren,  I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down  clothes and homemade ice cream and
leftover meat loaf sandwiches, I really  would.
I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you learn honesty
bybeing  cheated.
I hope you learn to make your own bed and  mow the lawn and wash the car.
And
I really hope nobody gives you a brand new  car when you are sixteen.
It will be good if at least one time you  can see puppies born and your old
dog put to sleep.
I hope you get a black eye  fighting for something you believe in, I hope
you
have to share a bedroom with  your younger brother. And it's all right
ifyou
have to draw a line down the middle of the  room, but when he wants to
crawl
under the covers with you because he's  scared, I hope you let him.

 When  youwant to see a movie and your  little brother wants to tag along,
I hope  you'll let  him.
I hope you have to walk uphill to school  with your friends and that you
live
in a town where you can do it safely. On  rainy days when you have to catch
a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to  drop you two blocks away so you
won't be seen riding with someone as  uncool as your Mom. If you want a
slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how  to make one  instead of buying
one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and  read books.
When you learn to use computers, I hope  you also learn to add and subtract
in your head.

I hope you get teased by your  friends when you have your first crush on a
girl, and when you talk back to your  mother that you learn what ivory soap
tastes like.

May you skin your knee  climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
>stick your tongue on a  frozen flagpole.

I don't care if you try a beer once, but I  hope you don't like it. And if
a
friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope  you realize he is not your
friend.
I sure hope you make time to  sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your  Uncle.
May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.
I hope your mother punishes you when you  throw a baseball through your
neighbor's window and that she hugs you  and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your  hand. These things I wish for you
-
tough times and disappointment, hard work  and happiness.  To me, it's the
only way to appreciate life. Written with  a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm
here for you.  And if I die before  you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for
you. Paul Harvey

When asked this riddle, 80% of  kindergarten kids got the answer, compared
to
17% of Stanford University  seniors.

What is greater than God,  More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
rich need it, and if you eat  it, you'll die?
>Send this to 10 people and then push  the shift key, it will give you the
answer. P.S. You wont believe this, but  this really does give you the
answer!!

278,28738,beck-s/discussion_threads/1019.,<31320729.1075855832185.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments 
arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 ""Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality...""

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when excelr Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know

Subject: MAIN Homepage Data


FYI, 

Based on consultation among MAIN staff and with the MAIN PC chair as well as the chair of the newly form MAIN Security Working Group, we will take or have taken the following actions in the interest of bulk power system physical security: 

1) All data on the MAIN home page formerly considered ""public"" but now deemed to have the potential to be used in sabotage acts against the interconnected electric systems is no longer available for immediate download. 

2) Those entities who have a valid, regular use of such data will be given password access. Current MAIN homepage passwords will work and anyone who has OASIS access via TradeAgent will automatically have access via the the links provided on the OASIS after log-in. 

3) Anyone who has a valid but infrequent use of such data will be screened before such data is supplied. This will be done through validation of phone and/or street address as well as company affiliation as necessary. In short, we will know the person who has asked for data. 

4) Instruction and/or forms will be available on the web to facilitate item 3 above. 

5) A modest charge to accomplish item 3 may also be required. 

At a minimum the following formerly public data is included in this protected group: 

- All MAIN electric system maps 
- Detailed capacity reports such as the 411/860 
- Parts of the FERC 715 submittal 
- Detailed roster information 
- outage listings 
- seven days or older ATC cases 
- Transmission Assessment reports (TASG, FSSG) 
- All other power flow cases (MDB, MMWG, etc.) 

I recognize that reports such as the 411/860 and FERC 715 also reside publicly on the FERC/DOE sites. Efforts will be made to have such data removed from the government sites as well and, I understand that FERC yesterday has already taken such action. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.

 *DJ Calif. PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX

 Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For Utilities

 LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission
approved a controversial plan Thursday morning that
 will allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outside
the Caliifornia Power Exchange market structure.

 The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners Henry
Duque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeper voted
 in favor of the draft order.

 The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energy
unit San Diego Gas & Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &
 Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison
(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that
 became effective in March 1998 when the state moved to a deregulated
competitive market. Originally the mandatory buy
 requirement was set to end in 2002, when all three utilities recovered
their stranded costs.

 ""This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds,"" Commissioner
Bilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said at
 Thursday's meeting. ""I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this will
result in lower prices patched through to bundled
 customers.""

 Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York Mercantile
Exchange can now compete directly with the
 CalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.
The utilities can buy power from other ""qualified
 exchanges"" through an advice letter process.

 Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now

 California's big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX market
structure immediately, through an advice letter process,
 which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent to
trade power with qualified exchanges such as APX,
 Nymex or Bloomberg.

 The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as the
CalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, and
 anonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - in
order to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange.

 Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.
excelr Online would not meet the criteria for a
 qualified exchange, commissioners said.

 The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality that
would not need to be approved by a majority of the
 commission.

 Mark Huffman, PG&E senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told Dow Jones
Newswires that his company ""will quickly start
 looking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to start
the advice letter process.""

 SoCal Edison and SDG&E said they will do the same.

 Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversial
three-to-two vote in favor of the draft order ""creates a
 tremendous opportunity for APX.""

 ""It allows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Valley technology to
California,"" Cazalet said. ""This is really about bringing
 e-commerce to the market.""

 E. Jesus Arredondo, however, disagreed, saying ""selling into our market
doesn't cost anything and selling into the APX market
 costs 20 cents per megawatt-hour.""

 Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lower
electricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and seller
 the chance to see prices before making the purchase.

 CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, Commissioner
Bilas said.

 Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer George Sladoje said
""Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor of
 accelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is not
well-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive.""

293,8309,arnold-j/bmc/3.,<25283265.1075849627805.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to ""what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?"" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the ""I don't want any surprises"" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team (""I 
don't see a problem here...""), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for ""credit"", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to ""lean on"" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a 
lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a 
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will 
there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can 
answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing 
y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet 
and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 
6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks.""

March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All 
business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business 
unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following 
tasks:

1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so 
that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can 
review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business 
responses.  

2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all 
incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line 
(x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail 
messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her 
line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a 
new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.

I am a new member of Jay Webb's excelrOnline technical team.  In my role, I 
have had the opportunity to review the EOL Reporting Database created by 
Eugenio Perez.  Eugenio has demonstrated good technical and problem solving 
skills in the development of the Reporting Database.  He was able to apply 
his knowledge of Microsoft Access and expand his programming skills.  He 
quickly developed an application that served the immediate needs of EOL.  
Eugenio should be commended for growing his technical skills to develop his 
first Access application.

Sincerely,
Chris"

Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

Subject: Re: Barcelona  

D Weekes is working with Tim P-P to address the resulting questions and 
should have a briefing memo together for distribution tomorrow.  We will 
follow up to answer Rick's questions at that time.  The major 
issues/questions are still a bit fluid since this just surfaced but  
presently include the following:

Issues/Questions
Exposure - Spread sheets in Liquids and CAS show dramatically different 
exposures of roughly US$ 68 MM (peak, now closer to $ 47 MM) for spreadsheets 
and US$ 13 MM for CAS.  I asked Tim to detail the anticipated exposure in 
coming weeks (ie. timing of cargoes in transit net of anticipated payments to 
be received).
Controls - Delayed mailing of Invoices by up to 30 days in some cases.  
Various other controls issues need to be addressed including where were the 
triggers in the system that should have flagged the issues earlier.
Legal Documentation - Why contract volumes were significantly exceeded and no 
documentation prepared to support trades once the 330k mtpy annual limit was 
breached?  The effect apparently was trades being done without contractual 
support.

Deliverables
Accelerate Feb month end payments (approx. 30 MM).
Disallow deferred payments from Muentes (up to 75 days in some instances) if 
customers are paying more quickly.  Current contract, now effectively 
expired, allows deferral of payments (1/3 each month starting with end of 
month of discharge).
Assign future A/R's directly from third parties on the other side of Muentes.
Create a lock box for future payments to avoid receiving $'s via Muentes.
Execute JV documentation that has now been outstanding for some time.

Goals - in sequential order:  reduce exposure to Muentes, paper 
non-documented transactions already done (ie. beyond volume limits of current 
contract, review mid/back office systems to avoid future problems, improve 
structure via JV or other interim steps if JV execution is still some time 
off.

D Weekes - Get with Ross Koller to make sure no new business is done with 
Muentes (beyond fulfilling new commitments).  Likewise, you or Hardy need to 
get with Tim P-P and R Quick in order to assure all are on the same page and 
agree the best way forward for this relationship.  Based on info. in hand, 
there does not appear to be an issue with Muentes' ability to perform (please 
confirm).  Therefore, care should be taken to maintain the relationship; 
however, I don't see the benefit in doing new deals with Muentes (beyond 
fulfilling current commitments) until the exposure is brought down.  Muentes 
does not appear to justify additional exposure based on my conversation with 
Hardy last week.  So, before the credit limit is reconsidered, the structure 
needs to be improved where payments bypass Muentes (via lockbox or another 
alternative) and A/R's assigned directly to ENE.  The new JV documents may 
take steps to improve the structure; however, this needs to be confirmed as 
it has been some time since the JV docs. have been circulated.

Subject: Barcelona


Steve I had a brief conversation with Rick today and Barcelona came up. 
My sense is that he is expecting an autopsy that answers how it happened 
(including) how the exposure ran up but didn't get flagged in the right 
places. Is somebody taking care of this ?

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, ""quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!"" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. ""Why are you
naked?"" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you.""

""Okay."" the man replies ""I'll go get ready.""

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

""Who the fuck are you?"" the man asks

""I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with.""

The husband exclaims, ""But you are naked!""

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

""Those little bastards!""

That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  

Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually 
the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those

either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 
10th or the 12th.  

We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would 
love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to

To recap.

1. I think Todd is going to be here on 25th March. HR eare sorting out 
accomodation for one month. Europe pay his costs, NA pick up family costs.

2. Spoke to Bernie A - Edith is going to be here for a week in the middle of 
Todd's month.

3. I'll be in Houston w/c 8th April - lets get together then for an update. 
Though I believe you may be here sooner than that?

4. Astros' - any chance of tickets for Wed 10th (v St Louis). I guess - to be 
extra cheeky - can I have 4 - to take Jo and kids? No problem if that's not 
possible.

Talk soon.

Roy,

Thanks for sharing your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs.  I will
include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April 18th NYISO
Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT
project.  Initially, this project was viewed as a ""quick hit"" which could be
completed swiftly, at minimal cost, and with minimal impact on staff and 
ongoing
project work.  Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the
case.

Question on CIT/CSS:

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

Response:

(Reported by Mr. Museler to the MC on 4-18-2001)

1.   There have been recent developments in the NYISO / PJM CIT process.  At 
the
present time, no software requirements document has been created, no vendor
contracts have been signed,  and a number of issues, including ensuring the
confidentiality of data, providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM 
based
system fails, and liability, all have to be resolved.

When the project was originally proposed, the NYISO believed it could be done
quickly with a limited amount of resources.  This has not proven to be the 
case.
Completing this project immediately  would take resources away from other
projects need for Summer 2001 and will have a budget impact of approximately 
$1
million.  The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project
to come ahead of the Summer 2001 issues, or to proceed without vendor 
contracts
in place and other outstanding issues resolved.  The NYISO will continue work 
on
the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments.

Question:

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the ""lukewarm""
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

Response:

With regard to the inter-ISO Congestion management pilot, Rick Gonzales offers
the following response to your comments:

2. Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Inter-regional 
Congestion
Pilot program. The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the
Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential
implementation of this program.

One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to
which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for cost-shifting between
ISOs. In addition to providing a list of 'candidate' operational constraints, 
it
was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to re-dispatch its
internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints. This
concept is in agreement with your understanding that 'ISO A only makes 
payments
to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in
A'.

Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Inter-regional Congestion
Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting.

C. King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to
SENY and the operation of the PARs (Waldwick & Linden-Goethals/Hudson 
faragut):

Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets, the full capability of the
Hudson-Farragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure.  The
equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the May-June period.  
In
preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service, NYISO and PJM staff
have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR
schedules to the PSEG-Con Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long 
been
associated with this equipment.  It would be pre-mature to establish a
congestion-management pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of
the PARs, until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs 
is
fully discussed and agreed to.
Both PJM & NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto 
earlier
this year, so this is nothing new.

Presently the equipment owners (PSEG & Con Edison) as well as NYISO and PJM 
are
engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating 
agreement
between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs.
Progress is being made, thus I think that every effort is being made to insure
that energy can flow between PJM and SENY, and between NY and New Jersey for
this summer and beyond.  We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and
other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast.

See you in Springfield next Wednesday!

Chuck

WASHINGTON, DC-- An increasingly desperate Al Gore called for a recount

Board. ""There 
is reason to suspect that these nine votes were not properly counted and that 
as many as five

therefore in the best

The originator who closed that deal in 1998 (or thereabouts) left a year ago or more, Sandra McDonald I believe. I can have Mike Garberding look into it if you like as he is very familiar with these structures. Jeff's issue, he called me as well, is that we post to APEA monthly yet Chase posts to excelr daily (or vice versa depending on the market) which can cause large exposures both ways. It's probably a good idea from both of our sides to correct that from a liquidity and credit perspective. I'll ask Mike to see if anyone left at excelr is familiar with APEA to open this discussion with them. The difficult part may be amending the margin agreement as I would assume these documents were pledged to the municipal bond holders.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested excelr employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call

Currency desk.  Clara was also working with the IT person we have in London 
who is  working to improve the processes of how curves are loaded as well as 
how cash flows are received.  
In the prior weeks when Shane and I met with some of the groups, I had told 
them that Clara would be over to follow-up on some of the items.

Sheila,

I am disappointed to say that neither Mike or I were knowingly told of 
Clara's visit and she didn't introduce herself or explain what she was doing 
to either of us. She also arrived at a time when Michael Kass was on holiday. 
As a result of this I am concerned about the success of her trip and some of 
the conclusions she may have drawn.

I would therefore appreciate it if you could arrange for a summary of the 
purpose, results and conclusions that followed her week's work so that we can 
all understand what the future holds.


Thanks James

Please join me in congratulating Paul Quilkey in his new role as Vice 
President leading our efforts in Australia.  Joe Hirl has assumed a leading 
role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional 
responsibility for trading activity.

Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in 
excelr Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he 
has accumulated to date in his career with excelr. It is worth noting that 
Paul joined excelr as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short 
time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his 
current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a 
dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, 
and far from excelr's traditional US markets. 

Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment.

Subject: Supervisory Leadership Classes

By now, you should be aware of the Supervisory Leadership Curriculum rolled 
out by Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago (see the posters in our elevator 
banks).  This curriculum was designed at the request of senior management to 
provide new and future leaders the opportunity to prepare for such roles.  
Feedback from the program administrators is that there has been a low 
response rate.  This may be due to confusion about eligibility and cost.  
Just to clarify - All of you are eligible to participate.  In fact, you are 
strongly encouraged to participate.  Further, those individuals within your 
groups that are leading efforts or are expected to step into such a role are 
encouraged to participate.  Please keep in mind that individuals don't 
currently have to be supervisors to attend the training; the idea is to 
provide training for new situations encountered as leaders.  Generally 
speaking, those at the specialist level and above should be considered for 
these classes - just use your judgment.  

Although there is a cost associated with these classes, it is minimal in 
comparison to the returns that can be gained through participation.  
Guidelines are available to help you target specific needs for yourself and 
your staff.  Please contact the training department to obtain a curriculum 
guide.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Susan

Subject: Kevin's RTO Ideas for East

TJ-Please forward to all of Kevin's trading group.  Thanks.
_____________

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance excelr's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
buses.""

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an ""network"" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the ""hubs"") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical ""zones"" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in excelr's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- ""Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.""  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes excelr and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow excelr to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

Jeff, 
I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we 
talked about.   He told me that he would make a recommendation after he 
completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
retention without market data. 
If this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know.   If you suspect 
that the managers are being made offers then please let us know.

Jeff Skilling has asked for a revenue number for EOL that represents what 
excelr reports on our financial statements (including the Mark-to-Market value 
of all of our open positions resulting from EOL trading).   We are 
specifically looking for MTM value as of the close of trading on the 15th and 
would like to be able to review the results by mid-afternoon (Houston) on the 
16th.   We will need each desk to calculate their EOL-specific MTM value and 
consolidate this information at the Commodity Group level (ie. U.S. Power, 
Global Liquids, N. American Gas, etc.) and return it to the Product Control 
Group (Torrey Moorer/Carrie Southard) by mid-afternoon on the 16th (Houston) 
in order to combine the information into a report for delivery on the 17th.   
We are primarily interested in the total MTM value of our open EOL positions, 
but if it is possible to provide a breakout for the MTM value of EOL physical 
sales, this would help us break out the revenue numbers.   If you have 
questions, please contact Torrey Moorer at x36218.

Subject:	Business Rationale for Retention 


As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. 

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please call me (5x3662) if you have any questions.

When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge

When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the

When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

on Captiva Island.  

Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It 
will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and 
changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim 
on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably 
go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red 
ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue 
chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a 
look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for 
you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have 
an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  

I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, 
too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items 
in them.  

Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication 
will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the 
infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just 
great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think 
that he dodged a bullet on this one.  

We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans 
yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I 
have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November 
birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday 
so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great 
day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I 
will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on 
Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive 
to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we 
could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!!

Here's my travel itinerary should anyone need to reach me:

Going:
Wednesday, Nov. 8
Delta 1258 to Atlanta - leave 9:15 A.M.
Delta 1920 to Ft. Myers,  Florida
arrive florida 3:35 P.M.

Return:
Sunday, Nov. 12
Delta 1677 to Atlanta
Delta 4741 to Austin
arrive Austin 6:30 P.M.

Staying at Sanibel Harbour Resort & Spa in Ft. Myers, Fla
941-466-4000
I won't have my cell phone with me, so if you need to reach me, leave a
message for me.   My roommate, should they not be able to locate my name, is
Laura Suarez.   We're all with the loud and overly-extroverted USTA group.

Should you need to reach Chris, call his work no. at 477-8787 and they will
be able to tell you how he can be reached in Singapore.    Wanna call Erica?
She's having her last hurrah at the farm - so I wouldn't disturb her if you
know what's good for you.

Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an excelr-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that excelr PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the excelr-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the excelr-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of 
time!  Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.  They know 
more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.  They both 
report to me.  Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations.  
They can help you on any details about our power business.  

My office is on the 30th floor - EB3015.  Stop by if you get the chance.  I 
will be moving to the 33rd floor during the week of July, actually while I am

Subject:	EDF request

John - I returned a call to Ira Polk and Kevin Davis today at Man.  Ira was not in so I spoke with Kevin.  

Kevin asked me if excelr would consider posting more margin than required by NYMEX on our option positions. He said that ""given ENE is now flush with liquidity"" he thinks it would make excelr ""look good"" in front of the EDF Board.  He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would be ""ecstatic"" with 1.5x (about $5 million.)  He specifically asked me not to elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what EDF is asking of ENE.  He also told me that if we did not post the additional margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market moved against our positions.  Kevin also state that EDF is too small compared to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deals and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank.  

I have been out of town so may be missing on part of the story but I think it's ridiculous that EDF wants us to do them a favour when they ditched us when excelr was in a  severe liquidity crisis.  I told Kevin that I did not think we would meet his request but that would check on it internally.

I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

JY
p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

Jeff,
The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for 
all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are 
at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.

424,43314,campbell-l/all_documents/1.,<29904087.1075849737366.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!"

Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Subject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy



Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial.""  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,""
Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem.""
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock.""
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey
said.

Noble is gone this weekend if you want to make another trip to Corpus.  It
looks like I will be a good weekend for fishing and nighttime entertainment.
Charlie and Bruce Robison are going to be in town for this Thursday -
hopefully it will be a good show.

Everthing is going great.  I heard that you division got purchased by a
Swiss bank or something to that effect.  Please verify?

Are you doing OK?

Subject: Upcoming Discretionary VaR Limit Changes

Per discussion with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy, the following policy limit 
changes are anticipated.  Note:  these are subject to change given market 
volatility.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------> 
EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01

Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ----------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM

NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------> 
EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)

NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 -----------------> 
EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01

       -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.



Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:


   now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 1/5/01 1/6/01
EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM

NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM

UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM

Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM



Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.

Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You 
can check with Ted to see if he did already.

Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the 
commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an 
extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and 
presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and 
Ted Murphy to approve.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I'm out on vacation this week, but 
can be reached at home or on my cell phone.

Happy Holidays,
Cassandra.

Jim,

Do you remember Rob Lloyd?  He know works at AIM Funds here in town.  Please read the piece below - I think it is well written and summarizes our sad situation succinctly.

Jean, 

Thought you'd find this interesting.  It's an excerpt from an analyst's note
out this AM.

A Perspective: R.I.P. excelr:
It took sixteen years to build excelr into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,
but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.

The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various
off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently
became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,
their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into
something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began
30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)
sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They
involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value
(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This
allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.

If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very
New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,
to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the
latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the
table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM
partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.
Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed
muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized
in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had
used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these
were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

If they were to schedule their gas directly to Golden Spread POI- 71395, operations could put them on the suction side of Plains turbine if we got full. Also Golden Spread would have to agree to flow the gas on a 24 hour basis and not 16 hour day.

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Joe and Sherry"

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the excelr South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from ""Williams Energy Services Company"", do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA's relationship with Williams Production RMT????

Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.

Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of excelr, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

The three have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce this week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, the Washington Times reported, quoting 
unidentified sources.
Gordon R. England, 63, who retired recently from General Dynamics Corp., 
would be nominated as Navy secretary; James G. Roche, 61, a vice president at 
Northrop Grumman Corp., is the pick to head the Air Force; and the choice to 
head the Army is Thomas E. White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said yesterday. 
The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with excelr, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

excelr's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist
David Lazarus
Chronicle Staff Writer

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A1
(Copyright 2001)

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of excelr Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
""It's very unfair,"" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
""He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem."" 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
""Everyone played by the rules,"" Lay said. ""Now our reputations are being 
maligned."" 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like excelr cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But excelr was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
""excelr and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. ""A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea."" 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said excelr was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
""This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,"" said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
""excelr isn't in the business of making markets work,"" Rozsa said. ""They're in 
the business of making a buck."" 
In an ironic twist, however, excelr now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. ""It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with excelr's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed excelr's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
""There's a long history of excelr pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants,"" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. ""What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be."" 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
""I have known the president and his family for many years,"" Lay said. ""I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies."" 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
""grossly exaggerated."" 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to excelr's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other excelr officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that excelr's profit from California energy deals last year was ""not 
inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for excelr, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at excelr's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing excelr in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
excelr is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, excelr might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
excelr could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
""We do best in competitive markets,"" Lay said. ""These are sustainable 
markets."" 
TRADING FRENZY 
excelr's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making excelr by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees excelr's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that excelr at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
""Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,"" Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
""There's truly a problem out there."" 
This is a recurring theme among excelr officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and excelr would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, ""The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace."" 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means excelr isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
excelr purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, excelr sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, excelr is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
""These guys are the pariahs of the power system,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost."" 
To be fair, energy marketers such as excelr can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where excelr actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like excelr can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame excelr and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
""California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines."" 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
""I have that concern,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word."" 
For his part, Lay insists that excelr has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."" 
As a sign of excelr's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has excelr signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
""None,"" he said. ""We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs."" 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

excelr boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

03/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but excelr Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based excelr for selling expensive power to California.
""Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage,"" Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. ""It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - excelr Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of excelr's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
""We didn't make the rules in California,"" Lay said. ""We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem."" 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. excelr encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
excelr's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much excelr has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was ""not inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" said Lay, who took over excelr in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that excelr has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories.""

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the ""Sports Illustrated 
curse."" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
""You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business,"" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
excelr (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company ""has been paying us,"" says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. ""We haven't had any 
discussions with them"" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have ""out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves,"" says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The ""10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,"" says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, ""you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes."" 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
""This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,"" says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, ""won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe."" 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
""It was a good move for them,"" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. ""They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work."" 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
""Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well,"" Hinchey says. ""But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps."" 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

Subject: RAC final pack

Hi Steve,

I am attaching the final version of your 2001 plan so that you get a chance 
to review it before our meeting on Monday. 

The new pack reflects any changes that were discussed at our last meeting, 
namely  a reduction in training courses to 2 per person and an increase in 
economy versus business flights .

I have also revisited the 2000 forecast and adjusted where necessary to 
reflect most recent running rates. I have  changed the 2000 headcount figures 
to reflect November actuals and have assumed no new starters in December so 
if this is inaccurate I will need to amend here. 

You will need to view the ""direct"" and ""rsc"" sheets to see the information. 


Let me know if you have any problems.

Many Thanks

Carmel

470,34848,beck-s/sent/550.,<10948555.1075855909489.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an excelr trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all excelr 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which excelr has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

I have heard through several sources that AEP has purchased the excelr Nordic team in Oslo.  This creates several issues that we must address:

Did AEP purchase any systems and/or contracts?
Are these employees still located in our office and if so are they assuming the building lease and associated expenses?
Do they still have access to our systems?
Who, if anyone, was not included in the AEP purchase?
Many of the deals were executed under ECTRIC - Nordic Branch; is this treated similar to ECTRIC?
Since ECTRIC still has not declared bankruptcy, we need to evaluate these portfolios immediately.
We probably do not have Commercial leadership in Oslo; therefore, we need to develop an action plan for that office.  

I believe that there were only Power and Weather transactions managed by Thor Lien in the Oslo office.

hare of the Thanksgiving  feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked qu=
estion from last weekend,  ""Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, wha=
t will YOU be drinking on  Thanksgiving?""  Before I reveal my T-day sampler=
 case, I wanted to let you  know what types of food we will pairing these w=
ines with.  We usually start  with some type of shellfish, some mild, some =
spicy.  For my family and  friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer so=
me traditional stuff such as the  best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (tha=
nks to Martha, don't you know), and  assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then c=
omes the main course: TUR-DUC-KEN  (always from our friends at La Boucherie=
), with all the 'fixins': jalepeno  cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffin=
g with sage, and a pile of different  veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepa=
red, but we usually stick to pretty  simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin=
 pie or pumpkin something.  This is  where the Riesling from the sampler ca=
se comes in.  It is also amazing with  the shellfish.  To make this meal a =
smashing success, I have selected the  following sampler case of 12 bottles=
:

CHRISTOPHER'S PERSONAL THANKSGIVING  SAMPLER (2 BTLS EACH): =20

Dear Karen, 

Thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the excelr 
Scholarship.? excelr's commitment to community service and education is most 
admirable, I and felt honored to be selected (particularly considering the 
other people chosen).? I even enjoyed the interview experience, mostly 
because of the neat interviewers.

I also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence, as well as the 
follow-up call this evening (even if the news was not quite what I wanted to 
hear).? It's great to see people ""doing it right"".? If you need any 
assistance with future events at UT, please don't hesitate to call.

Sincerely,

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

-Matt Rogers

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to excelr.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to excelr.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at excelr.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with excelr a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
excelr and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

Subject: Sale of HPL

To all: 

The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and 
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming 
months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the 
transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities 
and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements, 
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

Regards,
Brian

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  ""If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage 
in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.  
With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to 
search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.  He 
averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the 
Hornets to a 4-0 week.  Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early 
in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your 
league.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an 
injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.  He won't travel with the 
team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.  
With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for 
Carter until he is healthy.       

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 
 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position 
in Monday's game against Vancouver.  In what has been called the ""big 
backcourt,"" Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the 
shooting guard.  Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he 
could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point 
guards.     

 Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the 
Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' 
two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring 
punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup 
change.      

 Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.  
He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt 
that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.  Despite the 
injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.  With the success of 
so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his 
Fantasy value.  He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners 
in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.    

 Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.  He 
sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  
Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value 
in most leagues.  His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers 
is uncertain.     

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the 
Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.  X-rays on Atkins' 
ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New 
Jersey is still unknown.    

 Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games 
with a knee injury.  He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on 
September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.  Unless you are 
desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of 
Fantasy.     

 Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee 
against Atlanta on Wednesday night.  He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds 
in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the 
Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. 
The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. 
Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by 
swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn 
hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. 
 

 Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 
 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of 
his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman 
Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on 
the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.   

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 
 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday 
night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The 
fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.   
McGrady's status is day-to-day.    

 Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 
 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to 
repair frayed cartilage.   Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the 
source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst 
near the rear of the knee joint.   Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 
before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 
weeks.    

 Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee 
Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no 
real Fantasy value.     

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 
 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   DeMarr Johnson will probably 
start at shooting guard in his place.  Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the 
only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.     

 Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday 
before their game against Toronto.  Terry Mills was activated form the list 
to take Perkins' place on the roster.  Jermaine O'Neal will start at center 
in Perkins' absence.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 
 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left 
ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is 
probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 
 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had 
been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, 
keep him in your active lineup.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 
 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will 
be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.

506,41839,buy-r/inbox/351.,<22233076.1075840390155.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Rick,

My views are as follows:

- The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of significant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company should also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right to continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research into our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be conducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).

- The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than the excelr package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it may create an issue with the creditors committee for the excelr bankruptcy.

- The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my opinion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in light of the excelr situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

Subject: Dating Asian Women


Don't get offended, it's only a joke...obviously written by some bitter Asian 
guy.

Caucasian women:
First date: You get to kiss her good night.
Second date: You get to grope all over and make out.
Third date: You get to have sex in the missionary position. Then you promise 
to marry her but will probably abandon the idea.

Indian women:
First date: You meet the girl.
Second date: You set the wedding date.
Thrid date: The wedding night.



Chinese women:

First date: You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happens.
Second date: You buy her an even more expensive dinner but nothing happens 
too.
Third date: You don't even get to the third date and you have already 
realized nothing is going to happen.

Vietnamese girls:
First date: What first date? ... no such thing
Second date: You get married to some girl you've never seen before from 
overseas.
Third date: You divorce, get paid $10,000 from her family (minus a percentage 
from the guy that set you up).but only after you've helped them all immigrate 
to Canada or US take your pick.

Filipino girls:
First date: It took you forever to get a date with this really hot chick of 
your dreams (that has a killer bod), but she won't let you even kiss her.
Second date: She takes you to church and everyone thinks you're really cute 
and such a nice guy; but you still haven't even kissed her because she's a 
""proper girl"".
Third date: You kiss for the first time, but miraculously she ends up 
pregnant and you have to marry her or her cousins, brothers, uncles, etc., 
will cut your penis off, and you keep wondering what happened!? Even more 
miraculous: the kid IS yours!

Korean girls:
First date: She only went out with you cause she hates the steroid-pumped, 
chauvinistic Korean guys that
are always after her.

Second date: She flirts with all your friends, but ignores you.

Third date: She's dumped you and is going out with a black guy that is 3 
times your size (in every way). She doesn't even ""remember"" who you are, 
neither do her friends so you have no chance of ever going out again with a 
Korean chick cause they all talk and you were an asshole anyway.

Japanese women:
First date: She's shy, so you don't get to kiss her at all.
Second date: She'll take a bath in front of you and let you smell her panties.
Third date: You get to have kinky sex with her. Then she will bid you 
sayonara as that was her fling before getting married to a Japanese man.



Thai girls:
First date: You flirted with her while she was giving you a really bad lap 
dance.
Second date: You go play pool, see a movie, or meet at a club and she tells 
you how she is making so little money here, but better than her computer 
programming job back in Thailand. You're not really paying attention though 
because this is the first time you've seen her in the light and without 
make-up, the smoky haze, and the influence of alcohol.she is BUTT ugly!
Third date: She smiles and says hi as she passes you while she's on her way 
over to the table with all the
Chinese/Vietnamese gangsters.  She'll spend the rest of the night 
lap-dancing/smoking/talking with them.
You're afraid to look over cause you think you'll get shot or jumped in the 
parking lot. You vow to never go
there again, at least till your friend tells you about ""this really hot chick 
he saw there.""



And finally ...

ABC (American Born Chinese) girls:
First date: She met you in a group of people and you were the only Asian guy 
in the group. In fact you two are the only Asians in the group cause you're 
both bananas. People think you two should go out cause you're both 
Chinese.""   Second date: You go to dim sum, but neither of you can order 
because neither of you speak Chinese. The waiters give you really bad 
service, and you don't get any specials.
Third date: It doesn't work out, cause you're not Asian enough and she goes 
back out with some white guy she dated 5 years ago.  Eventually they get 
married and the Asian population diminishes! Or she decides she's a lesbian 
and goes out with some really Bohemian white chick that's into alternative 
music. and ends up fighting for some social cause for the rest of her life.



You marry an Asian girl and wonder what ever happened to your 
life...Or...money!!

Cindy

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.
 *****

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.
 *****

An English professor wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: ""Woman, without her man, is nothing.""   The women wrote: ""Woman!
Without her, man is nothing.""
*****

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost
another woman's self-esteem."

Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a

only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Sally,

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change

I spoke with Mr. Causey this morning and moved over here. We have been
working with your IT people on security but this is a new practice for
us that we are having great success in the energy companies. As we have
worked with more companies on the finance side of businesses we have had
to eliminate the IT terms so it makes a lot more sense to Risk Managers
now.
 
e-Risk Management starts with a way to manage the risks of e-commerce
such that these risks are understood from the technologists to the board
room and you can manage it.
 
Since this is such a new and radically different concept I have found
our literature confuses more often than it helps. It has some basic
tenants that are straight forward that can be presented and understood
but are not easy to write down. It is not a product.
 
First, we are going to define risk as the potential reduction in assets
from the threats of e-commerce. Now, you have more intangible assets
than tangible assets so that we have mastered. So this discussion is on
the asset management side and is a key concept to understand. Everything
else is based on that. Often we get in an income vs. balance sheet
discussion. In your case you have $11B in book value and $27B in market
value so you have $16B in intangible assets. There are two things to do
with these assets 1) protect them as you become e-commerce enabled and
2) figure out how to leverage and grow them with e-business. So this is
where we start. 
 
On the protection side e-commerce threats will come two ways. Your
largest threats are going to be on transactions, like trading, asset
acquisition or payments. Other threats will come from vulnerabilities in
your network. So this is both in trading, business strategy and
Information technology. That is the e-Risk management side.
 
On the growth side once we and you allocate these $16B of intangible
assets to categories, strategies can be built to grow selected areas. Of
course, fixed IT assets have a high need to be leveraged also.
Approximately 25% of your IT budget is managing boxes ( fixed assets)
that has no competitive value. That is what we are doing at Chevron.
 
For protection you can throw an infinite amount of technology dollars at
the e-commerce security requirement and not eliminate the risk (if you
pin your technology people to the wall they will finally admit this).
However, once you have e-Risk Management you can manage the costs of
technology and risk to what we call ""The Most Favored Case"" investment.
Companies have found this e-Risk concept should be completed before a
security policy is developed because until you do understand the asset
risk you don't know what to write a security policy to do.
 
Let me know if you need more. Many energy companies, especially the
utilities, have added e-Risk to Risk Management. Many recognize e-Risk
as the biggest going forward. This is aimed at getting that elevated
Risk Management concept under way.
 
Normally we would like to come in for an introduction meeting ( 1 1/2
hours) to get the basic concepts covered and then talk about what our
e-Risk Practice does. We are at Keller Springs and the Tollway in North
Dallas if you wanted to come here.
 
Thanks.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an excelr led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more ""permanent solution"" ot the NewPower issue.

533,44683,campbell-l/all_documents/70.,<28209390.1075851879126.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Two points were apparent after my last conversation with Bill Olson about a 
month ago:

1) Texaco has convinced Bill that the plume of elevated TDS originates from 
an offsite source; an old waterflood operation toward the northwest and 
upgradient of the Texaco and NNG facilities. Although our data from 2-3 years 
ago indicated the source as Texaco's old brine ponds, Bill indicated that 
Texaco has more recently presented data that is more regional in scope and 
implicates the waterflood operation. I have not seen any of this recent data.

2) Bill has accepted Texaco's single soil boring in the former crude oil pit 
area as evidence that the pit was not the source of oil found in NNG's 
monitor well MW-3. I don't agree, but our best chance of convincing him 
otherwise will not come until Texaco excavates the old pit area and completes 
the additional assessment activities we agreed to in our meeting with them 
last year.

In light of these two points, I think it is going to be difficult to convince 
Bill that NNG should not adhere to the biennial sampling until things are 
settled between Texaco and NNG. However, if you are going to give it a shot, 
I suggest that you present the position that:
1) Texaco has already demonstrated (whether correctly or not) that the 
dissolved phase plume of TDS originated from another source;
2) Texaco has already demonstrated that they were the source for the 
dissolved phase plume of benzene measured in NNG's fenceline monitor wells; 
and,
3) The only unresolved issue is the presence of PSH in monitor well MW-3.
In light of this, the only monitoring NNG should be responsible for is 
measuring PSH thickness in well MW-3 since it makes no sense to collect 
groundwater samples from a well containing free product. 

Also, the last information I have on Texaco's activities is an assessment 
report dated July 1997. If you would get a copy of any more recent reports 
and correspondence it would be a big help. 

Another thought to consider, prior sampling history indicated a declining 
trend of benzene concentrations at NNG's fenceline monitor wells. If this 
trend has continued, additional sample data would be beneficial to our future 
discussions with Texaco and the OCD.

Subject: Re: NNG Eunice Station  

Bret, what do you think about this?  We have pretty much proven that we are 
not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing 
sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated 
the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and 
either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the 
data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and 
inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional 
money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts....

Subject: NNG Eunice Station

The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in 
August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that 
calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

John,
Thank you very much for your time Wednesday afternoon ,we appreciate it. Your feedback is very important to us as we continue to define the end product. As discussed we too only see the value in the product  if we have mutiple ""customers"" participating and as I told you we have had many hedge funds and CTA's request a similar service. Over the next 2/3 weeks we will be presenting to a number of these interested parties and would be happy to keep you updated on progress. I anticipate more aggressive ""marketing"" of the product from September onwards as we are still stuck in the summer vacation schedule and it is making serious ""roadshowing"" difficult.
Again thank you for your time and please dont hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have or any further feedback you may want to provide (either to Deutsche or Campbell ).
Regards,
Kevin

he will fare against a tough Baltimore defense... Bledsoe is going against

Subject: Friday State of the Union

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like ""Spring Break Everyday!""  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got ""Tanked"" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying ""I DO"" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,""Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?""  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - ""Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?""  He responded, ""Have the odds come out already?!?""  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his ""Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut "" to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as ""Mullet of the Week""  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, ""A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper.""   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

          Phillip,

          Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market (
     approx.
          $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes
     due
          on Jan
          31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have
     to
          worry
          about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the
     value
          of
          your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the
          bottom
          line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to
     keep
          in
          mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you
     close
          that
          position you will probably get put those.

          Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.
     Also,
          if
          there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your
          proposal such
          as duration, maturity, etc.

Subject: Kern River Tank Sampling

John and Lou,

As we discussed during our trip to the airport from the SoCal PCB meeting, I 
had mentioned that I would like to show up at the PG&E's Kern River I/C tank 
and do some liquids sampling.  Is this still a go?  I have discussed this 
with Randy Williams of our Needles team and I have requested that he found 
out the driving directions to the tank from someone on PG&E, particularily 
from someone at their Topock C/S.  I have asked him to casually ask for this 
and not make an issue of it.  Because the field probably is more layed back 
about this kind of stuff and not in the political center, it seemed like the 
right thing to do and would not raise any flags to PG&E.

IDEAL IN FANCY CUTS

While there is a wealth of information about the various
definition of ideal cut round brilliant diamonds, most consumers
have no idea what constitutes great cut for the fancy cut
diamonds such as pear, heart, oval, marquise, princess, emerald
or radiant.  There is no one industry standard for round let
alone fancy cuts, but there are some specific guidelines that we
use when we search for diamond.

Each fancy shape has its own set of depth percentage, table
percentage, crown height percentage and length to width ratio
that will increase the likelihood that the diamond will have
great brilliance, sparkle and beauty.

If you are shopping for a fancy cut diamond and are interested
what specifications define the top cut class for that shape,
give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.

BULLETPROOF BEAUTY
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Beauty meets the bulletproof vest in a gown designed for Miss
Israel to wear at the Miss Universe pageant next month.  The
top of the silk dress, embroidered with diamonds and pearls,
is covered by an army-issue flak jacket adorned with diamonds
for a so-called softer look, the Associated Press reported.

The dress sends a message that everyday life should go on
despite renewed violence, its designer said.  ``I want people
in Israel to continue to go out,'' said Galit Levi, a Tel Aviv
fashion designer. ``But be careful.''

Levi also designed two prior Miss Universe dresses. In 1998,
her design featured the faces of Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat
and Bill Clinton, leaders known for Middle East peace efforts.
In 1999, the first Arab Miss Israel, Rana Raslan, wore a dress
with a large red Star of David, an Israeli symbol.

Ilanit Levy, an 18-year-old soldier from Haifa, will wear the
bulletproof dress in the Miss Universe competition May 11 in
Puerto Rico


$500 MILLION HEIST FOILED IN LONDON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Would-be thieves crashed a bulldozer into London's Millennium
Dome on Nov. 7, hoping to snatch $500 million worth of
diamonds=01*including the spectacular 203-ct. De Beers Millennium
Star. The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat
waiting on the Thames River. It would have been the world's
largest robbery, but the diamonds were already gone from
their tented exhibition arena, and Scotland Yard was waiting.
Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers, and a
dozen men were arrested without a shot fired.

Tipped off by police, dome officials had replaced the gems
with crystal fakes. De Beers officials say the pear-shaped
Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in
the world.

Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault
that usually houses the diamonds. Police picked up another
near a speedboat on the river, and a sixth man on the opposite
shore. Six others were apprehended later in southeastern
England.

Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co., which
operates the dome, said the diamonds are displayed in an
exhibition area of the facility called the ""money zone"" and
are closely guarded. The Millennium Star is displayed in a
reinforced glass cylinder, and the area has alarms and
security cameras. The collection also features 11 large
diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color.

Police said the robbers, apparently disguised as workmen,
crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer
past security guards at around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the
attraction opened for the day. As they entered the building,
they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs.
Fortunately, none of the estimated 100 visitors in the tent
were nearby.

Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the
dome. After the robbers went into the vaults and became
trapped, they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the
officers. The intruders were captured as they bashed at the
display cases with hammers and sledgehammers.


PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
For the past ten years, platinum prices have fluctuated
between $350-$450 per troy ounce on the commodity markets.
In the second half of 1999 the prices start a climb that
saw prices move from $350 to almost $650 per ounce at the
start of this year.  This increase is mostly due to the
big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies
have not been able to keep up.  Check out the price chart
at http://futures.tradingcharts.com/prairielinks/PL/M
that plots this trend.  Note how there are some weeks
where the price has $100 swings.

The impact on you the consumer is two fold, the prices you
pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and
the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes
take weeks to restock.  The other impact is that if you
bought jewelry with significant platinum content, it is
now worth more and would cost more to replace.  If your
appraisal is more than one year old, you might want to
consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes.


CLARITY GRADING
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Undoubtedly, size is an important factor in determining
the clarity grade.  The more difficult it is to see an
inclusion, particularly face-up, the less it will
influence the clarity grade.

Almost as a part of size, the number of inclusions must
be considered.  Clarity grading does not, however, consist
of merely counting inclusions, but rather judging how
readily that number can be seen.  A stone could, for
example, have a number of minute pinpoints and still be
graded high on the scale.  Usually one or two of the
largest inclusions will establish the grade.  Additional
inclusions, if small or minute, will have little or no
effect on the grade.

The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be
seen.  Cutters call the area seen through the table the
""heart"" of the stone and make every effort to orient rough
stones so that inclusions are not visible through the
table of the finished stone.  The preferred position for
inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle
because they are less noticeable there.

Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause
multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look
at the stone in the face-up position.  Such reflectors
lower the clarity grade more than similar non-reflecting
inclusions.

The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity
grade.  Most inclusions do not threaten a diamond's
durability.  Remember, long before a stone ever reaches
the consumer, it has already been subjected to considerable
heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing
processes. It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply
by being worn.  But large cleavages or feathers,
particularly when they reach the table or extend from the
crown through the girdle, are potentially hazardous since
they could be extended by a severe blow.

Most inclusions are white or colorless, but sometimes
they are black, brown, dark red, or green.  These, or
course, are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more
than a colorless inclusion.  However, curiously enough,
a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often
surprisingly inconspicuous.

Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the
diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye.
The high price associated with high clarity has more to
do with rarity than beauty.  If most diamonds were flawless,
it is likely that included diamonds would command the
greatest interest and price.


OCTAHEDRON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality
diamond crystals.  The octahedron is shaped like two
pyramids, one upside down and fastened at the bases.
Perfectly formed octahedrons, called glassies, are among
the most striking of all mineral crystals.  Rough crystals
with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular
round and princess shapes.


WHERE DIAMONDS FORM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Diamonds form only under certain chemical, temperature,
and pressure conditions.  Scientists estimate that the
necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist
in parts of the Earth's mantle (inside the crust) between
75 and 120 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific
type of peridotite rock called kimberlite.  The Australian
diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called
lamproite.  For billions of years, kimberlites have
periodically carried diamonds to the Earth's surface.

We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary
deposits.  The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it
breaks down with sunlight, heat and cold, wind and rain, and
other environmental forces.  The diamonds often get washed
out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they
gather in potholes and eddies. These are called alluvial
deposits.  If the river currents are strong enough, they
may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea.  There
the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back
onto the beach.  These diamond rich areas are called
marine deposits.  Diamonds found in alluvial and marine
deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said
to be from secondary deposits.

After a quick discussion with my group I think Sally B. owns operations. I 
guess if Sally is OK with it - I couldn't see why we woulden't be.

Thanks, Bjorn.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the 
past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this 
from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I 
assume this is a policy change?

They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there 
are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking 
to take over:
 - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the 
Settlements Clerk could handle;
 - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk 
could handle this as well, or someone 
   in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.

I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub, 
and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they 
to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls 
between offices?

 Sue

Bjorn,

Are you the person to go to for advice on changing Sydney process and 
controls?   We're trying to address the need for some changes, and I'm not 
sure who in Houston to go to for sign-off.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY

salesperson says ""done"" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

excelr places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Subject: Progress on Daily Trading Ledger - note from John Paskin and Mike 
Jordan

UAT on phase 1 of this application development has identified previously 
unforeseen technical and functional requirements/issues. Consequently, a 
comprehensive re-specification and re-planning exercise for DTL has been 
completed such as to give a much later implementation timetable.

Given the immediate, and absolute, need to implement the more significant of 
the control and efficiency improvements identified in this project along with 
the competing demands for existing IT development resource we have decided to 
:-

pause development work on the DTL application ( specifically )
apply business analysis resources on the full redesign and documentation of 
ledger control and reporting processes
complete the process changes within the Trade Accounting area that have been 
on-going for the last 6 months
reassign IT resources to the Enlighten and Envoice projects
reassess the timetable for the delivery of the residual DTL control and 
efficiency improvements by re-preforming the business case for the DTL 
application following the completion of the above identified work

Please feel free to discuss any of the above issues with us

Regards

John & Mike

The following  letter was sent today to the Midwest ISO Transmission Owners:
 
As we  move into the Market Trials period, I would like to reiterate how much the  Midwest ISO appreciates your support of our ongoing activities. 
To facilitate your participation in Market  Trials, we are providing two types of informative, interactive orientation  sessions.  One covers the  Electronic Scheduling Process and the other provides an overall Market  Trials Orientation.  These  sessions are designed to provide an essential overview of the drills, scenarios  and reviews necessary for your people to actively participate in the Market  Trials.
The Electronic Scheduling Process  session is available on three different dates in July and the overall Market  Trials Orientation session is offered on two different dates.  Because of the interactive nature of  these sessions the class size must be limited. Ideally, we would prefer no more  than two participants from each company. Please select the individual(s) from  your company who will attend these sessions, and forward the attached  registration brochure to them.   Please advise me if your needs exceed the requested attendance guideline  of two people per company. We will make every effort to accommodate your  request.
We recognize that asking you to sustain a  steady commitment of time, resources and manpower is an exacting demand.  Your confidence that your Market Trials  participants gain as much knowledge about the Midwest ISO's operational  abilities is equally important to us.
We are grateful for your continued support  of the Midwest ISO and look forward to working with you during the Market Trials  period. 
 
Sincerely,

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days.

Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to 
work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on 
pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the 
desk to use.

Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Service this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tulsa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  This is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  They would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyday to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to capture, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks, 

Bob"

Subject: Practice - TONIGHT


Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

Subject: Annual Report VAR Disclosures - open items

This is Part II of the open items on VAR, addressing ECM, PGE & affiliate 
books

From my review of Eugenio's consolidated VAR spreadsheet, the following 
listed items are those that are open that we           need information from 
you on.   Corp. is looking to type the first draft of the Annual Report (to 
be discussed with the Audit Committee) THIS FRIDAY, so we need your help with 
this information as soon as possible.  If you will not be able to have all of 
the information to Eugenio by Thursday night, please let me know.  We may be 
able to give you some additional time to gather some of the smaller pieces.   
If you need to forward this on to others, please do so.

AA if you know of any other issues of completeness that I have not addressed, 
please let Eugenio and I know! 


*Have AA and Jan Johnson concluded that we only need to include the puts on 
the excelr stock?  If so we need all twelve months of comparable data as 
applicable.    Steve Ross sent to Eugenio on Monday (yesterday).  Let him 
know if he needs to re-send it.

*Are the swaps shown on the ECM FN3 schedule for the phantom stock plan the 
puts that we have been talking about?  If not do these swaps need to be 
included in VAR and the non-trading portion of FN3?  I haven't seen them 
before.   These are new puts.  I checked with Jan.  She said to include the 
positions as non-trading equity.  The trades were both done in November by 
Gary Hickerson's group.  Be sure he hasn't included them in his numbers.  
We'll get the VaR for November and December to you on Wednesday.  (Steve, 
this is yours).  

*What is Yosemite?  Is it a TRS that I need to include in VAR and FN3?  
Internally we call it a swap but in the legal document it is called an 
Agreement.  It's actually more of a guarantee.  I talked to Jan about it and 
we don't think it goes in FN3. 

*For non-trading I\R and F\X, we are still missing all non-quarter end 
months.    Jeff, this ones yours.  We need to send the information to 
Research and have them run the VaR monthly in 2000 also.

*PGE - January,February and March VAR is missing on Eugenio's schedule.  I 
don't have a clue what PGE's information is.  I only know about Rhythms which 
is in a separate section.  You'll have to ask PGE.

*What month was the EOG sale effective?  We need commodity affiliate for all 
of the non-quarter end months prior to the sale.  The sale took place August 
16.  I have never even heard of any EOG commodity affiliate position.  I was 
told Greg Adams handled these at one point.  I'll ask him tomorrow.

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an excelr publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure excelr top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
excelr to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

631,24558,beck-s/_sent_mail/775.,<19909360.1075856094109.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building excelr's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with excelr Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Carl has been working with excelr and others and the ISO to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for the Desert Southwest (which the ISO would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Ziad:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a ""reformed"" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion 
reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the ""hour-ahead"" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.  

Carl

any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to

Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment  

I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say "" well that is what 
you say every year""), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment  

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of

country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.

Subject: Rollout of ATHENA (Formerly known as the DPR database)


Dear All,
 
Risk Analytics, has recently finished developing ATHENA (the database that 
warehouses all of the official DPR data of excelr), which is designed to make 
your work easier by giving you the following tools and breakdowns:

1. P&L Component Breakdowns
? Hedge Management
? Prudency
? Curve Shift
? New Deals

2. Risk Analysis Tools
? VARs
? Maturity Gap Risk
? Net Open Position
? Daily loss limits

The warehoused information, which is broken down by books and parts (P&L 
component breakdowns/risk analysis tools), now has the visual aid of numerous 
bar graphs and pie charts used to represent the information listed above - 
provided to you at the touch of a button.  These charts are not only very 
easy to understand, but will be helpful in your daily work analyzing trading 
information.  

Now that all commodity groups are performing additional analysis and 
providing reports other than P&L and positions to both MRM RAC and commercial 
departments, the tools provided by ATHENA have been proven to be extremely 
useful.  

ATHENA makes analysis of the time trend of data an effortless process, as it 
has warehoused data for the past year for each commodity.

The rollout of ATHENA is currently underway, according to the following 
timeline:

? From now until Friday November 10th, access to the database is being given 
to the beta testers (testers already chosen).
? Monday November 13th - First instructional training class from 4-5pm. 
Conference room 3270.
? Thursday November 16th - Second instructional training class from 3-4pm.  
Conference room 3270.  
? Subsequent classes will be scheduled depending on need.
? Production users will have access to the database within the few weeks 
following November 16th.
  
Each of these sessions will hold up to 15 participants, and attendees are 
taken on a first come first serve basis.  Please contact Pamela Sonnier (ext. 
37531) to sign up for one of these training sessions.

We expect that all business controllers will want to have access to ATHENA. 
Additionally, there may be other employees in your group who need access.  
Please send all requests for access to ATHENA to Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon 
(ext. 35257), Jennifer Nguyen (ext. 57590), or Eugenio Perez (ext. 35828) 

For further information on ATHENA, or to set up a one on one demonstration, 
call Eugenio Perez (X35828), Maria Teresa Peon (X35257) or Jennifer Nguyen 
(X57590).

Best regards and looking forward to working with you,

I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.

	Subject:	RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

	The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today?s business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.

			Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

			Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

			Thanks,

			Raetta

				Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

				I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

				Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

				I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )
	- Find and select your name
	- Double-click your name or click Properties
	- Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep. 
2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard
	- Close any open messages
	- Click Tools, Options, Mail Format, Signature Picker
	- Click New and then type ""vCard"" for the name
	- Click Next and then click New vCard from Contact
	- Find and select your name, then click Add ->, OK 
	- Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name
	- Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create)
Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go. 

Sending an E-mail with your vCard
	
	- Create a new e-mail
	- Click Insert, Signature, vCard to insert your vCard 
	- Send your e-mail 

Receiving a vCard via E-mail

If someone outside the company sends you a vCard, how do you quickly add it to your Contacts folder?

	- Double-click on the vCard icon in the e-mail (this will bring up the new contact properties)
	- Add any additional information you wish
	- Click Save and Close

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of excelr, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said yesterday. 
The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with excelr, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

excelr's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist
David Lazarus
Chronicle Staff Writer

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A1
(Copyright 2001)

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of excelr Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
""It's very unfair,"" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
""He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem."" 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
""Everyone played by the rules,"" Lay said. ""Now our reputations are being 
maligned."" 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like excelr cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But excelr was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
""excelr and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. ""A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea."" 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said excelr was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
""This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,"" said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
""excelr isn't in the business of making markets work,"" Rozsa said. ""They're in 
the business of making a buck."" 
In an ironic twist, however, excelr now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. ""It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with excelr's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed excelr's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
""There's a long history of excelr pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants,"" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. ""What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be."" 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
""I have known the president and his family for many years,"" Lay said. ""I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies."" 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
""grossly exaggerated."" 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to excelr's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other excelr officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that excelr's profit from California energy deals last year was ""not 
inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for excelr, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at excelr's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing excelr in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
excelr is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, excelr might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
excelr could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
""We do best in competitive markets,"" Lay said. ""These are sustainable 
markets."" 
TRADING FRENZY 
excelr's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making excelr by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees excelr's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that excelr at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
""Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500,"" Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
""There's truly a problem out there."" 
This is a recurring theme among excelr officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and excelr would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, ""The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace."" 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means excelr isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
excelr purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, excelr sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, excelr is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
""These guys are the pariahs of the power system,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost."" 
To be fair, energy marketers such as excelr can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where excelr actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like excelr can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame excelr and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
""California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines."" 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
""I have that concern,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word."" 
For his part, Lay insists that excelr has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."" 
As a sign of excelr's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has excelr signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
""None,"" he said. ""We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs."" 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

excelr boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but excelr Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based excelr for selling expensive power to California.
""Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage,"" Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
""I told him we couldn't support it,"" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. ""It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse."" 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - excelr Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of excelr's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
""We didn't make the rules in California,"" Lay said. ""We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem."" 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. excelr encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
excelr's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much excelr has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was ""not inconsequential."" 
""We benefit from the volatility,"" said Lay, who took over excelr in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that excelr has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
""I don't know of any of that,"" he said. ""It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories.""

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals
Kathleen Pender

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
B1
(Copyright 2001)

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the ""Sports Illustrated 
curse."" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
""You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business,"" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
excelr (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company ""has been paying us,"" says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. ""We haven't had any 
discussions with them"" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have ""out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves,"" says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The ""10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,"" says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, ""you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes."" 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
""This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,"" says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, ""won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe."" 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
""It was a good move for them,"" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. ""They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work."" 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
""Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well,"" Hinchey says. ""But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps."" 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally ""False""


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

retiring today and I'm basically supposed to replace
him on this project, but I've been so busy with other
projects that I haven't had any time to pick his
brain.  So I am fucked but large.

Send the package to the office.  Our secretaries don't
do shit for me ever, so they can at least lug my
gifts around.

This weekend isn't good for a chat, unfortunately.
I leave for Boston tonight and T and I might go
skiing.
This is the last time I'll see her until after Vegas,
since she leaves for India on Tuesday and I leave
for my 6 week sojourn after that.  So I plan to get
very acquainted with my right hand.  Maybe I'll have
time to acquire some skill with my left.

I may very seriously blow my brains out while we're in
Vegas.  I saw Fight Club yet again last night and
shooting himself in the head seemed to work for Ed
Norton.  One thing is for sure, there is definitely
no downside to shooting yourself in the head.  Unless
you paralyze yourself or something.  That's the thing
about life.  As awful as it is, it can always be
worse.  In my case, losing the ability to terminate
myself at any time would be the worst thing ever.

Its raining today, also.

Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

visit in September.  I forwarded the attached file to James New and Mike 
Jordan several weeks ago and had hoped to discuss it with them.  I have had 
no response and, therefore, I assume that they agree with the direction that 
was laid out in the departure meeting (Sept. 15) with Gregor, Paul, and Risk 
personnel.

The three areas addressed in the report are as follows:

Pool Book P&L Split
EnPower Structure Modification
Transmission Valuation

Pool Book P&L Split
I have spoken to Anthony MacDonald about the progress and as I understand, he 
has offered to devote time in order to inform James and Coralie Evans about 
the underlying problem.

EnPower Structure Modification
Paul can certainly give you a more detailed understanding as to the Legal 
Entity decision process and amount of rework time that is required of your 
Risk and Confirmation groups.  I have discussed this problem with Zhiyong Wei 
(Houston's EnPower support) in order to inform him of the situation and Paul 
mentioned that he has also spoken with Brian Hudson.

Transmission
As of my last communication with Houston IT, the testing was almost 
complete.  At the departure meeting mentioned above, we considered valuation 
of transmission as a spread-option to be Plan A and further agreed upon a 
Plan B and C.  The report details the operational risk involved in valuing 
transmission by using the Forwards deal type in EnPower.

Since I have communicated with James and Mike and now with the 3 of you, I 
have completed my responsibilities on this project.  We have now formalized a 
direction with backup plans and I would encourage testing by the London 
office to ensure that what meets the West Power desk's needs will also 
address yours. If you need to further discuss this report, feel free to call 
or set up a meeting.

We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market 
information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public

I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made 
public right away.  

1. What information is not public that would be helpful?

2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action?

my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no

The purpose of the report is more to provide management (some of them outside of EPI) an update on investments experiencing issues.  Additionally, the classifications ""Watch"", ""Troubled"", and ""Loss""  form the basis of a merchant investment portfolio report that Rick Buy provides to the Finance Committee at each Board meeting.  The Watch report provides RAC an opportunity to get EPI's input for that process. 
 
All that being said, we are certainly open to changes that help us better accomplish these objectives.  I am ready to discuss at your convenience.   Regards!     Rick C.

DEFUNCT ""STIMULUS"" PACKAGE IS UNCLE SAM'S UNINTENDED GIFT

Uncle Sam sent taxpayers an unexpected gift last week: an economic 
""stimulus"" package that never made it off Capitol Hill.

Many economists, critical of the proposed government spending 
increases, have pointed out that the economy had already started to 
show signs of recovery anyway. Other critics correctly point out that 
the ""stimulus"" had enough pork to keep special-interest groups 
hibernating high on the hog till next winter.

There is, however, another reason to have frowned at Washington's 
""stimulus"" proposals and to rejoice at their demise. Government 
""stimulus"" packages are not, as environmentalists might say, 
""sustainable."" They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private 
investment -- the fuel of economic recovery. And when a government 
""stimulus"" is financed by inflation, it tends to undermine the source 
of that fuel: capital formation.

This holiday season we can thank Congress for its inability to agree 
to ""help"" the economy. But, unfortunately, we're still haunted with 
visions of Christmas past, when bad legislation has gone back to 
conference committees only to be return as even worse legislation.

Too bad Washington, DC, doesn't have a ""no returns"" policy.

ODE TO JOHN ASHCROFT AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

So long as Americans have freedom of speech, there is hope that the 
flame of liberty will remain lit. In that spirit, we offer the 
following ditty posted on the website of The Nonviolence Web.

    ""Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties""
    (Sung to the tune of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"")

    You better watch out,
    You better not pout,
    You better not cry.
    I'm telling you why.
    John ashcroft's coming to town.

    He sees you with your lawyer.
    He listens to every phone;
    He reads everyone's email,
    and he locks you all alone.

    With little tin guns
    And tiny cellphones
    Rooty hoot, hoot, he's breaking in homes,
    Big Brother is coming to town.

    He knows when you are traveling.
    He knows who you're around;
    Tried in military courtrooms,
    Not a lawyer can be found.

    He's makin' a list,
    and checking for race,
    Gonna arrest those who are dark of face.
    Big Brother's coming to town.

    You better watch out,
    You better not pout,
    You better not cry.
    I'm telling you why.
    Big Brother's coming to town.

A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION

Christmas, a holiday rooted in both Christianity and pre-Christian 
celebrations of the winter solstice, is also an appropriate time to 
reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization 
over the course of two tumultuous millennia. Among these values: 
freedom of conscience, peace on Earth, and goodwill toward men.

These values transcend any particular religion; they are in fact 
articulated in varying degrees by most of the world's religions. Yet 
they have found their fullest expression in the West. Why?

Because in Western culture more than in any other, the individual counts.

""This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western 
civilization,"" writes Paul Craig Roberts.

And it is this individualist precept -- respect for the dignity and 
worth of each human life -- that holds the key to understanding the 
unique institutions of the West.

The West's individualism, writes Roberts, ""permits an individual 
person to put his or her foot down, to take a stand on principle, to 
become a reformer and take on injustice.... It has made the 
individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens, protected 
from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech.""

Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the 
progressive forces of what one economist termed ""creative 
destruction,"" so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar 
phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas. This perhaps is the West's 
supreme paradox (and achievement) -- its tradition of questioning 
even tradition itself.

Concludes Roberts: ""Be we religious or be we not, our celebration of 
Christ's birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our 
souls and of our political life on Earth. Such a religion as this is 
worth holding onto even by atheists.""

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on excelr's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the excelr Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.

CKing@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Joe, Don,

As Joe indicated in his TIE response, voltage limits and voltage-collapse
limits are studied off-line using detailed AC power-flow techniques.  The
resulting limits (in kV) are translated into a MW transfer limit  for the
flowgates affected by the original voltage limit.  To the extent that these
surrogate limits reflect the expected voltage performance of the system,
then SCUC/BME and SCD will secure the system accordingly.  These rely on DC
powerflow techniques, which by their nature are Blind to voltage problems.
When this occurs, OOM is one tool that can be used to secure the system.

When the realtime operation deviates from the conditions assumed in the
analysis used to determine the voltage limits, the use of OOM and/or other
measures may need to taken by the Operators to secure the system

I hope this clarifys the situation.

Chuck

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Generators are supposed to be dispatched in the DAM in accordance with
their generator commitment parameters, many of these parameters are not
respected.
The minimum runtime is the one that is garnering the most attention, but
there is another parameter that would appear to be modeled incorrectly
which can have a significant impact on both the penalties applied to
generators and also on the issue of system security as it is applied to
system reserves.

Generators are loaded in the DAM in accordance with their loading rates,
the minimum loading rate for generators is 1% of their maximum rating. A
500 MW unit will have a loading rate of 5 MW/minute.

As an example of how SCUC loads generators I will use actual dispatch
data from Arthur Kill 2.

Arthur Kill 2 has a maximum rating of 359 MW and therefore has a loading
rate of 3.6 MW/minute.
The unit minimum is 90 MW and when dispatched from one hour to the next
should be constrained to what the unit can actually load.

We have received dispatches on our unit that would have the unit loaded
to 90 MW on average for one hour and then loaded to 241 MW for the next
hour. If the unit started loading at the end of the hour and loaded at
its loading rate of 3.6 MW/minute the unit would have loaded to 306 MW
by the end of the next hour. the unit would have loaded 3.6 MW/minute *
60 minutes or 216 MW. The increase of 216 MW represents an average of
108 MWhrs for the hour. Add the 90 MW from where the unit started from
its previous hourly dispatch and you will have an average for the next
hour of 198 MWhrs, this represents the maximum hourly average this unit
can perform and yet SCUC has the unit loaded to an average of 241 MWhrs.
This is impossible for the unit to load to and should represent a
deficiency for this hour in the DAM.

To further increase this problem SCUC has accepted the reserve bids from
this unit for both 10 minute spin and 30 minute spin for the hour that
the unit was already loading at its maximum loading rate. Since the unit
is already loading at its maximum rate, the unit should not be
considered for reserve since it cannot participate.

This problem is not isolated to this particular unit and is replicated
on our other units also.
If generators cannot follow their DAM schedules they must buy this
energy from the R/T even though it is impossible for them to match their
physical capabilities against their financial obligations as they are
dispatched to in the DAM. Add this to the fact the unit(s) are unable to
provide reserve to the system when they are already loading at their
maximum rate represents a system security problem.

I would suggest that SCUC only load generation at what the generation
can actually load to and be restricted to a maximum change hour over
hour of 30 minutes times their loading rate and if the unit is already
loading at its maximum rate then it should not be able to participate in
the reserve market.

I may be missing something but then again maybe not, hence the note to
the TIE list if other generators are affected in a similar fashion.

We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if
you can answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day
swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is
no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full
swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring
a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

We look forward to getting your Nov. 10 hourly  deals. If you would, please 
set up an email list with:

bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com
ellen.clardy@ipgdirect.com??  Phone # is 713/647-6603
suzanna.strangmeier.@ipgdirect.com?  Phone # is 713/647-7325
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com?  (The latter is our shared, group email  
address.)
?
Thanks so much for your cooperation and rest  assured, we're endeavoring to 
get the Cin index out by 9:15 a.m. each weekday.  Is that the optimum time, 
getting the index out after options  expire?
?
This will take some time, getting people to  cooperate, but we will prevail.
?
Also, please note we're collecting historicals for  ComEd, TVA and SPP, if 
you want to include those deals (no indicative necessary  at this time).
?
Thanks, guys! As always, call if we can be of  assistance--

I am not sure Marshall or the orignation team has much understanding of the true value of this from of credit risk syndication.  We have reviewed some of these policies in the past and enforcing claims is not as clean as cash or l/c's.  Legal opinion was not very favorable in the past either.  I am not sure how much of this we should do and what precedent it sets for the rest of our portfolio.  If we do any it should be centralized on predictable credit exposures (A/R or annuities) and not volatile MTM exposures.  
 
That being said, we have big targets in ugly credit markets which will require we take on some more risk.  An insurance policy is better than nothing but lets make sure McMahon understands that comparables to credit policies for the gas and power market is not relevant when his business is clearly different.

Rick/Bill 
The steel team (Bruce Garner et al) here is considering a credit insurance product to support their sales into uk market.  Paul Maley, who is from the insurance world, has been part of the discussions and believes that there is a viable product for a portion of the business.  Not a fix for long-dated mark-to-market exposure out of Russia, but probably could release some credit capacity for sales to weak industry names on a delivered/unpaid basis into first world legal environments.  A bit pricey but may be less expensive on a per $ basis if lots of transactions.  He has been in touch with David Marshall in Global Risk Managment (Houston Insurance guy).  I suggested that Paul and I get together with you guys to go through in some detail.   This is encouraging that people are working on such things, but it would be great if we set the pace and organized the process.  Speak to you tomorrow or Thurs.

myself and will also keep you informed as to the what our options will be.  

If you don't need this info or there are any questions let me know, otherwise

As we discussed on Thursday, I am putting together some discussion points for the individual risk groups regarding the receipt by credit of complete credit information.  Essentially, I am trying to determine how pervasive the problem is of credit not receiving accrual books with credit risk.  The probable reason for this is that certain books require accrual treatment for accounting purposes.  Once I hear from Debbie/Mark on the message below, I will start working with the individual risk groups.  

Regards

Subject:	accrual books

I've been thinking through credit's need for the forward values on 3rd party trades that are treated as accrual for accounting purposes.

I'm planning a meeting with the different risk heads to discuss the volume of transactions that fall into this category, but before I do that I need confirmation from you that I fully understand what you need the information for.  If you could, please confirm (or explain what I'm missing in my reasoning) the following in regards to forward values for third party trades treated as accrual for accounting purposes:

Margins - you do need these forward values for margining purposes.

Credit limit - you do need these forward values when determining total exposure per counterparty against their limits.

Analysis - Potential Exposure, margin liquidity, counterparty by curve - I think you would need these positions for your analyses.

Credit reserve - the value would not be needed for the credit reserve, as the purpose for the reserve is accounting related.  As these books are treated as accrual for accounting purposes, they should not be considered in the reserve.

Once I hear from you I'll work with the different BU's risk groups to see if there any problems with these types of books (problems such as them not being calced daily).  I'd like to meet with them early next week, so if you could get back to me as soon as you can, I'd really appreciate it.

Best regards

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

?
Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.? How's everything 
in Houston?? Things in banking are slowing  down.? I'm just hoping that this 
project I'm staffed on will go live.?  There is a 90% chance.? Most activity 
now in Asia is M&A related.?  You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. 
Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.? High yield and convertibles appear 
to be rocketing.? I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but 
so far things are  okay.??? Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to 
park the  money.? Maybe I'll invest it in power technology?since California  
lacks electricity.? Who knows.?

I heard from Jens that you moved to excelr Online.? Jens got a great  vacation 
in Cuba.? I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.

It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in 
and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the 
summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at excelr!!  It is kind 
of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations 
has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so 
many others.  

My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is 
""two and a half"".  What a delight he continues to be!!  
 
I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing 
well.  --Sally

I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
control my enthusiasm over seeing you.

I apologize if I disrupted you.

P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
very well and very much in love.

Subject:	Outstanding Invoices

excelr Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors.  
 
If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) .  
 
Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification.  
 
I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices.  
 
I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.
 
If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.
  
Thank you for your commitment to improving our accounts payable process and for paying our vendors on time.

The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean

the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the

once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.

Please read the note below related to one of our guys who participates on the

772,43946,campbell-l/all_documents/17.,<14217993.1075851877842.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Larry, this is a potential issue, at least from an accounting perspective. 
The total dollar amount for 1999 Expense in the ET&S Albuquerque Region is 
$345,000 (excluding Gomez, Bell Lake, & N. Crawar remediation projects which 
are accounted for separately due to sale agreements). This amount is not 
allocated for specific projects but includes all environmental O&M costs for 
the region. As it is, this amount may not be sufficient to cover costs for 
the ongoing Expense projects, including: Thoreau Lease Payment, Roswell 
Remediation, WT-1 Dehy Area Remediation, WT-1 Pit Area Remediation, Eunice 
Monitoring, & Puckett Monitoring. The Albuquerque Region 1999 Capital budget 
for remediation projects is about $270,000; this includes: Thoreau 
Remediation, Laguna Groundwater Remediation, Lockridge Remediation, and 
Atoka-1 Remediation. If the capital projects are rolled into O&M, the O&M 
budget will be far too insufficient. A related issue is concerning the 
allocated AFUDC costs. These costs will add about $60,000 to the Thoreau 
Remediation project cost and about $10,000 to each of the Laguna and Atoka-1 
Remediation projects. These costs were not budgeted for because I was under 
the assumption that new work orders would be issued for 1999, in which case, 
AFUDC costs would only be allocated based on 1999 spending charged to the new 
work orders. New work orders were not issued and the 1999 budgeted amount for 
the Thoreau Remediation of $78,000 can not possibly absorb the anticipated 
AFUDC costs. 

I will keep you posted of any further developments. Thanks, George

Subject: AFUDC on Remediation Projects

George,
This whole deal is still up in the air.  When I brought up the subject of 
AFUDC to Property Accounting, they started questioning whether these 
particular projects qualify to be ""CAPITAL"" at all.  I discussed the matter 
with Dan Pribble and he says to leave them as capital as long as I can but 
Property Accounting is going to want some real substantial justification 
before long for continuing to carry them in their arena.

And, if we end up having to dump a substantial portion of the total costs in 
all 5 of the current workorders to O&M, that will really kill the O&M budgets 
of the affected Teams.

So, don't do anything different from what you have been doing until we tell 
you different.

Thanks.

our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data 
along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price 
will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the 
web or via automated processes.  

Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to 
date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define 
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely 
what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the 
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to 
generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure 
Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and 
expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data 
is available via D&B Connect.

Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a 
longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing 
with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your 
perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of 
customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his 
boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long 
term preferential contract that we are looking for.

Let's discuss further.

Ffoulkes/LON/ECT@ECT 

Subject: Dun & Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading

I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several 
issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better 
solution for the money.  

Option 1
The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to 
monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.

Option 2
I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If 
you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :
 
 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores 
that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per 
record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently 
with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive 
alternative 
        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).

 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be 
provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a 
weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has 
not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates 
than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to 
transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost 
for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. 

Option 3
D&B Connect Product.
 D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated 
reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that 
enables the  most effective integration of customer information and 
third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and 
information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate 
identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete 
relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of 
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so 
that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your 
organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B 
Connect is scalable.  

 Cost Typically ranging from
 * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
 * CAM Online - $50,000
 * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether excelr 
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained 
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to excelr customers, 
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available 
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this 
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be 
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be 
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit 
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. 
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of 
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This 
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this 
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit 
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is 
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if 
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased 
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

713-853-6079.

the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do you
think?

   Lynn,
   We lost our discussion leader for the ""mismatches during ID2"" topic.
   Are
   you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
   important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
   everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but all
   of
   the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.
   Thank you,

      Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
   meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
      ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
   Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
      group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
   Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
      email address is theresa.hess@excelr.com.  In talking with
   Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
      Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
   cancellation.

      One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
   ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
      pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
   the excelr pipes and I wold like to know
      if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these
   mismatches.  If you would like
      to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

      Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
   Thanks. Lynn

One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  

I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  

Planned invitees from excelr are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  

Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of ""more senior"" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  

Who would you like to include from excelr at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally

Rick:

I have put together a brief campus update, including all previous and future events for the fall recruiting season.  Changes to our original campus plan are noted on the attachment.  As you can see, I still need 3 interviewers for October 16th.

All of our events have been well-received on campus.  The presentations that we have given to various student organizations have been of great benefit to our recruiting effort.

Regarding our campus numbers, I intend for the following:
Full Time:
Round 1: interview 55 candidates
Round 2: interview 36 candidates
Super Saturday: invite 15 candidates
Target: hire 10 candidates

Interns:
Round 1: interview 14 candidates
Round 2: interview 8 candidates
Target: hire 5-6 interns

	Please let me know if you need anything else or if I can provide any additional information.

	Thank you!

Subject:	IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.

In preparation for the upcoming move to excelr Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems."

Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I 
had a blast with you being here.

I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have 
the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked 
right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today 
(happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his 
worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on 
the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.

I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the 
rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more 
fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.

gotta go.

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements

	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.

ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for=
 Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w=
e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20
?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc=
hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,=
 which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be=
tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap=
pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan=
ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience=
d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou=
tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan=
ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv=
er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --=
 we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit=
h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus=
iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W=
ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov=
e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac=
ted users could not access their e-mail.
?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger=
ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus=
es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail =
is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop=
s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning=
 updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. =
 The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance=
 of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus =
product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w=
e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the excelr co=
mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t=
ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that =
will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th=
e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to =
get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las=
t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the=
 overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and=
 meet excelr's business needs and expectations.

on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544."

have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not

The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you.

intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Rocks Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.

Subject: Re: excelr Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net excelr position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.

?
Careening toward the week 11 games as we try to  keep you on top of all the 
latest happenings.
?
Before we jump to this week's Updated Players in  the News, I wanted to let 
you know we've updated the Target  numbers.? Understanding how many times a 
player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how 
an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.? You can find the WR targets 
here http://www.cheatsheets.net/wrtargets.htm?and  the TE numbers here 
http://www.cheatsheets.net/tetargets.htm??  Enjoy.

News galore....let's jump into  it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl)  is doubtful with a concussion. He has not practiced 
all week. QB Danny  Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is  expected to sit another week with a sore shoulder. 
Doug Flutie gets the start  again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will  not play this week. Jim 
Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug  Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give him 
the  quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal)  practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected 
to start this  week. If he cannot go because of his back, Cliff Stoerner 
would start. Randall  Cunningham is also hurt with a sore knee and has not 
practiced.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Coach Dave Campo says he'll wait 
until Sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.? We expect it to be 
Aikman, but given this  uncertainty, I'd look elsewhere for a QB.
?
QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to  play through his ailments. This week will 
be no different.

QB  Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is expected  to 
start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is  expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to team, 
Maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not  appear on the injury report, but has a 
sore knee. He is expected to start this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and  did not practice on 
Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play  or not. John 
Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could also  use 
Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a situation you should  
avoid if at all possible.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)  continues to draw conflicting 
information. Some say he's looking a  little more likely to start Sunday.? 
Others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.? Even 
if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.? I'd look 
elsewhere if you can.

QB  Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played through  it 
the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh  (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not start. The 
team named  Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard  (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected to sit 
this  week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL)  is out for another 2-3 weeks.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Kurt Warner  (StL)? St. Louis Post Dispatch is 
reporting Warner will have the  pins removed from his finger Tuesday.? 
Remember early on that Warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were 
removed.? Most feel that's way too  optimistic but expect to hear a lot about 
this soon.

QB Shaun  King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday. He  
practiced on Thursday. 

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will  likely be added today to the injury report with a 
sore back. He expects to play  on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this  week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Running Backs  in the News:

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore  knee. He did not practice 
on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo  (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) will likely play although 
Sam Gash will be the  starter.? Keep an eye on Ayandbadejo as he quietly had 
some very productive  weeks early in the season.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf)  returned to practice and will play this week.

RB  Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to play  
with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka's (Car) outlook has dimmed?a 
little as he was  downgraded to Questionable.? He wasn't able to practice any 
this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.? If he can't go, Brad 
Hoover will  start at Tailback.? Yes, that would be the undrafted Fullback 
Brad  Hoover...

RB Brandon Bennett (Cin) is healthy enough to  play this weekend. He will 
backup Corey Dillon.

RB Jamel White  (Cle) is expected to cut into Travis Prentice's carries this  
week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) is expected to play with a  sore ankle.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) was able to  practice and will play this week.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB)  is likely out for the rest of the year. Ahman Green 
will start in his  absence.

RB Shyrone Stith (Jac) missed Wednesday's  practice, but heexpects to play if 
needed.

RB Ricky Williams (NO)  is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

RB Joe  Montgomery (NYG) is listed as questionable and did not practice  
Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets  continue to list 100 players on 
the injury report. He will start on  Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles  and was held out of 
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week,  but looks as if 
he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-time  decision which 
is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will keep you posted  regarding 
any breaking news regarding his status.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Tyrone  Wheatley (Oak) was unable to practice 
Saturday according to ESPN's John  Clayton.? He could still play Monday as 
he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.? I'm very leery though.? If I 
had another comprable  back, I'd go there this week.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is  expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but isexpected to start 
on  Sunday.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) skipped Wednesday's  practice, but ishopeful of 
playing on Sunday.

RB Fred Beasley  (SF) is doubtful with a sprained ankle. He has not  
practiced.

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) is out for another 3  weeks.

*** Saturday Update? RB Trung Canidate  (StL) is rumored to be making his 
first appearance this week.?  I'll be interested to see how he affects 
Watson's playing time.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a  sore hamstring, but expects to play. He is 
listed as questionable on the injury  report.

RB Eddie George (Ten) is banged up with a sore  knee and toe. But look for 
the iron-man to suit and play on Sunday.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten)  went through the Saturday walk 
through today and looks to start.?  

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will use the bye week to heal  his sprained wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Wide  Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore  hamstring, but is expected to play. 

WR Tim Dwight (Atl)  will be downgraded to questionable on Friday's injury 
report. He has  sore ribs and could be a game-time decision.

WR Travis Taylor  (Bal) was placed on injured reserve and is lost for the  
year.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal) gets another start with Taylor 
gone.?  

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

WR  Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore  hamstring.

WR David Patten (Cle) has not practiced and  is doubtful this week.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle)  practiced on Wednesday despite being listed as 
questionable with a sore  knee.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Darrin Chiaverini  (Cle) will miss Sunday's game.

WR Raghib Ismail (Dal)  has a torn ACL and is lost for the year.

WR Chris Cole  (Den) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

WR Germane  Crowell (Det) will not play this week. He is recovering from a 
broken  foot.

WR Desmond Howard (Det) missed Wednesday's  practice, but isexpected to play 
this week.

WR Corey Bradford  (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad strain. He 
has not  practiced and is doubtful for this week.

WR Terrence Wilkins  (Ind) was criticized heavily by the coach to the media 
this week. Coach  Mora has stated that E.G. Green will see more playing time 
this  week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his  stiff neck and will play 
this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)  used the bye week to get healthier. He is expected to 
play this  week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia)  is expected to play this week with a sore foot. He will 
not start  though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be the  starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract  extension. ""She"" should be 
there for many years to come.

WR Jake  Reed (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

WR Ron Dixon  (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play  with his sore shoulder.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) is expected  to play with his sore back.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ)  will also return kickoffs after the team cut Kevin 
Williams.  

WR Charles Johnson (Phi) is expected to play with a  sore shoulder.

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea) was held out of  practice Wednesday and Thursday with a 
sore quadricep. He is listed as  questionable on the injury report.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  practiced Friday and looks like 
he'll play at least  some.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and  Thursday'spractices with a very 
tender toe. He's listed as questionable and  could be
a game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra  action if 
Owens can not go.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Terrell Owens  (SF) took part in about 70% of 
Friday's practice.? Coach Steve  Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not 
starting Owens Sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.? 
The amount he could play will be  determined by how Owens feels at gametime.? 
This is so tough to call as  he's one of the elite WRs in the game and 50% of 
Terrell Owens is better than  100% of lots of other WRs.? People always want 
numbers so here's my  opinion:? 
Chances he doesn't play at all:?  25%
Chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50%
Chances he plays and looks like the Owens we've  been seeing: 25%
Weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your 
team and situation.? He's a high risk, high  reward decision this week.? If 
you're pretty well set and just need a few  points out of your WR slot, I'd 
probably bench him and find another guy.?  If you need to swing for the 
fences, I'd probably be inclined to gamble on him  and keep your fingers 
crossed.? 

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the  least hurt of all the receivers and will start 
on Sunday. He is battling a sore  back and ankle. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten)  is listed as questionable on the injury report, but 
expects to start  with his sore back and ribs. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as 
questionable  this week. For those that have followed his career, this 
usually means he will  not play. 
?
***Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) surprised us and put together 3 
solid days of practice at the end  of the week.? Coach Fisher was even 
talking about the Titans taking some  shots downfield and Thigpen figuring 
into the gameplan.? We've heard this  before so be careful.? 

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is  still bothered by a hamstring and was not able to 
practice at full speed. He is  not likely to make much of an impact this week.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Carl Pickens (Ten)  is inactive for this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA)  was signed by  Washington.

//////////////////////////////////////

Tight  Ends in the News:

TE Chris Gedney (Ari) has sore ribs, but is  expected to play. He practiced 
on Wednesday and Thursday.

TE  Derek Brown signed with Arizona.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)  will likely be held out one more week with his ailing 
shoulder. Casey  Crawford gets the start at tight end now that Wesley Walls 
is lost for the  year.

*** Saturday Update? TE David Sloan  (Det) was added to the injury report 
with a hamstring injury and is  questionable according to my friend Steve 
Cohen of Pro Football News and Injury  Report.? He's a gametime decision now.
?
*** Saturday Update? TE Tyrone Davis  (GB) has a torn rotator cuff that will 
require surgery in the  offseason.? In the meantime, he's falling behind 
Bubba Franks for the  primary TE job.

TE Eric Bjornson (NE) has lost  his starting job to Rod Rutledge.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)  is expected to play with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Anthony Becht's  (NYJ) prospects are looking better 
with Fred Baxter's injury.?  
?
TE Freddie Jones (SD) has turf  toe, but is expected to play through the pain.

TE Stephen  Alexander (Was) is on a bye this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Kickers in  the News:

PK Matt Stover (Bal) has a sore finger, but it will  not keep him from 
kicking on Sunday.

PK Mike Vanderjagt (Ind)  inked a five year contract extension.

PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on Monday. He 
is listed  as questionable, but has not practiced. The Raiders have looked at 
Brett Conway  and Chris Boniol, but have not signed either one. We will watch 
this one close  for you Friday and Saturday.
?
*** Saturday Update? PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) is still not 100%.? He 
tested his foot today and  according to ESPN's John Clayton, the results were 
less than encouraging.?  He may still go but I'd look elsewhere this week.

PK Jeff Wilkens  (StL) is expected to handle FGs this week. Jeff Hall was 
signed earlier  in the week and will perform kickoffs and is the backup to 
Wilkens if he can't  kick.

PK Eddie Murray (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Scott Bentley (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Kris Heppner (Was) was released after his  several miscues cost the team a 
victory this past week.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

823,8051,arnold-j/all_documents/777.,<31756825.1075857607865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, excelr can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

month from Dec00.

**************************** November 28, 2000  ************************

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to
dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York
City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities
and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock
in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be
heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem
off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break, Easter,
Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out the
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10089324.

ELITE STATUS ON TWA AFTER ONLY ONE TRIP
If you've been considering discretionary leisure travel in December, this
deal could give you the inspiration to confirm. If you have to travel in
December, this deal gives you a bonus that lasts long after you land. Fly
just one roundtrip by December 31, 2000 and we will jump your TWA Aviators
frequent flyer status to elite level--a level that usually requires 25,000
airmiles in one year. If you like free, space-available upgrades to First
Class and bonus miles on all your future trips, you're going to like this
benefit. we'll even show you how to do it on reduced fares. For full
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10108936.

Subject: Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information 
(dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to 
Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen 
email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to excelr's 
internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would 
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared 
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are 
questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the 
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being 
distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info 
back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the ""o"" drive under Corporate called 
Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential 
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email 
address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the 
IT Central site: http://itcentral.excelr.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  
Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their 
terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

Some phrases you wish you could say at work:

1. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again...

2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
in  public.

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

were as follows:

Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a 
telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make 
available desirable office space within the excelr, Three Allen Center and 
Brookhollow office buildings.

MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike 
Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly 
Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill.  
John will assume responsibilities within excelr on May 8.

Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with 
repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units.  
It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions 
testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an 
air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify 
this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the 
appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . 

Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and 
Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review 
committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for 
reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return 
back to Bill by the mid term review meeting.

O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal 
training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions 
of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in 
GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and 
where.  An excelr letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 
to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT 
regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to 
the EPA.

MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will 
keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review 
process and procedures to be employed for doing the review.

Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a 
list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have 
impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this 
notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or  
relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). 

Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be 
generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills 
and releases.  The ""cut line"" for the work order generation is $1,000.

Subject: social security

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an excelr element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and excelr's in-house police 
officer (who works from the excelr building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally

Subject:	Suggestions to help short term morale

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.  

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. 

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view excelr as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of excelr at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. 

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. 

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. 

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the ""Re:"" say ""Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000""
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

Subject: Re: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns
  

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with excelr, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on excelr's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
excelr by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that excelr is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which excelr recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the excelr message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for excelr extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many excelr participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Subject: Bonus Communication

Received your e:mail today about bonus letters not being ready until next 
week.  Timing is fine.  However, Brent Price (EGM operations) received bonus 
letters for his operations team this afternoon from his HR team.  Brent will 
be out of the country on business next week, so he will distribute those 
letters right away.  

This highlights the issues that I raised earlier this week when I found out 
that not all operations personnel had been transferred to ENW as of January 
1.  Not only do we have different HR teams with apparently different 
directives, but some of my team is still defined as an integral part of a 
business unit (EGM and EIM) and the bulk of my team is operating as service 
providers through ENW (dedicated of course to the success of excelr Americas, 
but somehow starting to feel a bit removed).  I think that Robert Jones is 
running down how I can get access to systems that give me information on 
operations employees who support EA, EGM and EIM.  While necessary, that is 
really not addressing my point.  My conversation with Greg Whalley on moving 
operations under Net Works was very explicit on making that an all or nothing 
proposition (i.e. we would move ENA, EIM and EGM operations employees under 
ENW).  I asked about London, but he deferred at the time on that one.  But 
there was not deferral on EIM and EGM.  This movement out of the business 
units is not an insignificant change.  

I still believe that this needs to be all or nothing.  We have now created 
two classes of operations staffs - one that is  part of trading/origination 
operating companies and one that is part of Net Works.  The company will 
benefit if we can freely move employees from operating company to operating 
company to capitalize on skills.  We have done this quite frequently in 
operations in the past, moving people from gas to crude products or gas to 
paper.  We have now made that hard, because we have operations personnel on 
three different payrolls - ENW, EGM and EIM.  This creates assumptions around 
value judgements as well.  EIM and EGM personnel are more integrally linked 
with their business units than those who support EA.  Over time, this won't 
be a good message.   The promotion memo that you plan to send out this week 
highlights this problem.  When I asked whether operations personnel under 
Brent Price would be included in the memo, the answer seems to be ""no"", 
because ""they are not ENW employees"".   And yet we ranked and made promotion 
decisions on Brent's staff jointly with ENA and EIM operations personnel.  (I 
had actually drafted a promotion memo from me that would cover all operations 
promotions regardless of business unit that they service, but I will not move 
forward with that given that your memo
 will address those promotions - or at least some of them)  This seems like a 
small issue but is just a great example of a myriad of complications that 
will arise .  

My question again is whether this situation is bad execution on someone's 
part, or is it reflective of a change in Greg Whalley's view on having all 
operations personnel under Net Works?  Have McConnell/Shankman and 
McMahon/Bowen lobbied to have their operations personnel remain as an 
integral part of their teams, reflected tangibly through remaining EGM and 
EIM employees?  If that is the case, I fear that this inconsistency won't 
serve the company well as the year progresses.  

We have time on the calendar on Friday, so we can discuss this further then.

Lynn:

This is a busy place and I know you're quiet busy also.  Sometimes the only alternative to communications is emails.

I just wanted to get in touch with you and just let you know that this facility was finally sold.  The buyer is EOTT.  I have been offered a position with EOTT and their benefits seem to be comparable to excelr's however there are some changes.  After 19 years I hate to leave excelr, so I just wanted to see if you would keep me in mind if any positions become available.  Working in the scheduling and nominations area for you with NNG has been the most rewarding experience in my career and I would love to get back to an areas where I felt that I excelled.  I know that there has been some changes in the last few years, however, there is nothing holding me back at this time.   I certainly would have stayed if my family situation would not have been what it was 5 years ago.  I was not looking for a job, God just seemed to drop it down at  time that I needed to do something.  

Speaking of family, my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful, beautiful, responsible and extremely lovable daughter.  We have become such great friends.  The adolescence years gave both of us some major growth in our lives for the best.  She is living in England right now, working and going to college.     I am very proud of her.

We are in a transition month, we become EOTT employees effective August 1.  I will try to touch base with you i the next couple of days.

Thanks for your consideration.

Nelda

+Montana Power Sells Oil and Gas Business Unit
The Montana Power Co. has sold for $475million (US) its nonregulated oil and
gas business unit to PanCanadian Petroleum Limited of Calgary. The sale
includes subsidiaries that have interests in crude oil, natural gas and gas
liquids exploration, production and marketing in the U.S. and Canada.

Proceeds from the sale would be invested in growing Touch America, MPC's
national fiber-optic and wireless broadband telecommunications subsidiary.
The U.S. businesses have operations in northern Montana and in the D-J
(Denver-Julesburg) Basin north of Denver as well as minor properties in the
Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, and Green River Basin, Wyoming. Fractionation
plants are at Cut Bank, MT, and Ft. Lupton, CO. The Canadian properties
reside mostly in southern and central Alberta and in southern Saskatchewan.

+Deutsche Telekom to Buy Powertel for $5.89bn
The Financial Times said that Deutsche Telekom is expanding in the U.S.
mobile phone market by acquiring Powertel, a local mobile operator in the
Southeast, for about $5.89 billion in shares. The deal comes just weeks
after DT moved into the U.S. mobile market through the $50 billion
acquisition of VoiceStream.

As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is
structured as an all-share acquisition of Powertel by Voicestream. The two
U.S. companies have also agreed that the deal will go ahead even if DT's
takeover of VoiceStream is not completed.

Communications Holdings, Inc., a unit of SCANA Corp., owns approximately
14.6 million fully diluted
common shares, or about a 27% equity interest, in Powertel, representing an
investment of $249 million.

Shane and I spoke yesterday regarding the USD curve. Whilst taking a curve 
other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a 
formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&L 
concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our 
USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is 
going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at 
attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the 
amounts). Depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the 
business heads here in London.

Rick,
Shane Dallman and I are trying to speak with James to discuss the Libor Curve 
and its impact on London's reporting.  The Libor curve is published daily in 
Houston at 3:00 pm (CST) at the close of US Trading.  

The Global Products books are now final closed from Houston so their areas 
should not be impacted.

We will update you when we have spoken to James regarding his areas and 
possible ways Rate & Currency can assist.

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Some Road to the Presidency
Al Gore is contesting the Presidential election not from clawing ambition,
his spinners tell us, but because he has divined that he really won. Maybe
so. A mind that can count a dimpled chad as a vote is capable of believing
about anything.

Mr. Gore's professed high-mindedness would be easier to credit, though, if
it were not washed in the casual attitude toward the truth that we have come
to expect from the author of no controlling legal authority, the Buddhist
Temple fund-raiser and the iced tea defense.

The Vice President in his Monday speech to the nation repeated the
professions of supermouthpiece David Boies, for example, that there were
10,000 votes in Miami-Dade uncounted. These are in fact votes that were
machine-counted for other offices but did not register a vote for President.
The common-sense view of such a ballot is that the voter wanted to be heard
on other offices, but did not like either candidate for President. There
were 175,000 such ballots across the state of Florida, and 1.25 million
across the nation.

What Mr. Gore really wants is to pour over the 10,000 Miami-Dade ballots in
search of the mysterious ""dimpled chad"" votes for him. Bear in mind that the
county's board back on Nov. 14 shut down its first recount after a sampling
of three precincts turned up only six more votes for Mr. Gore. That seemed
in retrospect to be the sort of reasonable action so thought to be missing
from this endless exercise. The Democrat sued, forcing Miami-Dade to resume.

The Gore team currently argues that Miami-Dade is an undiscovered motherlode
of Gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced a
Gore gain of 157 votes. But the recount went through the precincts
numerically, and the first tranche, heavily Democratic, are known to have
voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore. While those 135 initially counted
precincts gave Mr. Gore 73% of their vote, the Vice President's share of the
whole county was 53%. Those potent projections of Gore numbers from a full
recount that they're citing are undoubtedly an exaggeration.

The Gore lawsuit against Palm Beach is richer still. Here they are literally
arguing that poor Judge Burton and his colleagues didn't use sufficiently
low dimple standards, what the lawsuit calls ""incorrect legal standards,"" to
accept Gore votes. Here as well we have a Democratic county and board, upon
whom the Gore folks were heaping praise less than two weeks ago, which
they're now suing.

In Seminole County, ""independent"" Democrats have sued to kill absentee
ballots certified for Governor Bush, who carried those votes by almost 2 to
1. Their case: The county's elections supervisor broke the law by letting
GOP office workers enter voter identification numbers left off of request
forms sent in by absentee voters, who had otherwise complied by signing the
form and listing the last four digits of their Social Security number. Want
more detail? Normally the ID numbers are preprinted on the forms before
they're sent out, which is what the Democrats did, but the GOP's software. .
. . Oh well, the Democrats are suing.

So let's review the story so far. We had a Florida count Nov. 7, then a
recount, and then we let Al Gore pick several famously Democratic counties
to hand-count; we've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted, let
his party officials eyeball the ballots, often going his way by a 2 to 1
vote, let a GOP counter in Broward resign, extended the pre-established
deadline and, let's see, what else? Oh yes, Mr. Gore still lost.

The Gore/Boies strategy now is essentially to sue everyone in sight, hoping
that some cache of votes reopens (Dade) or closes up (Seminole). His lawyers
argued yesterday that he'd already be ahead if so many military ballots
weren't counted. This is not ""counting every vote""; it's asking lawyers to
overturn an election, not once but several times. And it's becoming
increasingly apparent to the American people; two national polls put support
for a Gore concession at 60%, a strikingly high number given the close
election result.

As to the Democrats, a few have wavered publicly on joining the Gore long
march, but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates, on the
one hand standing behind Mr. Gore's attempt to reverse the election, while
simultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming Bush
Administration.

All this said, we have in fact found one Gore gambit to really admire:
Identifying that five-minute seam of network time for a speech at 8:55 p.m.,
five minutes before the start of Monday night football. Pretty clever. The
dimpled-ballot standard may not stand up, but opening up that 8:55
prime-time window for political speech may last forever.

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: ""Where would you like to put this tree fat man?""

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.

I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown

I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom

Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments 
organized for him. 

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, 
Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to 
come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to 
Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for 
summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and 
Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any 
appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule 
allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas 
meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on 
Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family 
will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston 
that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally "

Subject: RAC issues

Fernley

Output from a meeting with David and James on the specific issues :-

David's view is that a detailed factual list of issues is as yet not 
available but the summary is as follows :-

At present Europe is substantially hitting the two key deadlines of 
'officialisation' of the books by Risk management by 6 am Houston time and 
Summary DPR received in Houston by Noon ( indeed have internal deadlines 1 
hour before that for contingency )
However, there are some IT problems in that the feeds to Houston post 
officialisation are currently taking a number of hours - and IT are currently 
looking to rewriting feeds and purchasing a dedicated server for feeding to 
Risktrac.
Additionally, because of the time difference between the two targets and the 
fact that Risk Managament do not obtain MTM information until completion of 
the overnight batch ( ie start working first thing in morning UK time ) there 
has been scope for continuing to work on the raw MTM data. Consequently,
there is potential for Risk Management 'top siding' for corrections such that 
the summary DPR will be 'different' from the risktrac information - We do 
topsides because it is impossible, given current systems, to rerun the 
overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems - our p&l 
explain processes are themselves spreadsheet based.
The majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal 
entry stage - itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation 
process of risk systems
Whilst the topside adjustment is communicated to Houston  - Risktrac requires 
a fully automated process
Whilst we should consider the materiality of the topside - RAC rightly are 
trying to implement zero tolerance - to help flag all the issues
Within the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on UK Power 
such that the full database was incorrectly valued - there was insufficient 
time ( for reason stated above ) to rerun and reextract and indeed today the 
batch failed because the UK Power server ran out of processing diskspace.

We are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies 
we face ( and that have been flagged on a continuous basis - they are on the 
long list for development ).

The recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of 
the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues - and we 
should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy 
compliance ( we should recommunicate the policy internally within Europe )

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

No one could prove that it was those young men, but there was reasonable

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an 
excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting 
to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected 
volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of

e=20
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20
=09?? Bob Nance=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=
=20
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =
he=20
was running tentatively.=20
=09
=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =
loose=20
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=
=20
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =
do=20
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=
ds=20
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=
=20

=09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli=

=09?? Reggie Reeves=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=
=20
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =
is=20
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game=
=20
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr=
om=20
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20
=09
=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=
=20
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=
=20
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=
=20
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=
=20
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.
=09
=09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf=

=09
=09
=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=
t=20
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=
=20
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=
=20
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=
on=20
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =
is=20
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=
ht=20
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20
=09
=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =
going=20
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=
ey=20
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=
=20
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=
=20
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=
=20
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20
=09?? Larry, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=
own=20
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=
=20
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=
o=20
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=
=20
=09
=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=
een=20
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=
=20
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=
=20
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=
er=20
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=
=20
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=
=20
however, may be too late against a good team.=20
=09
=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=
o=20
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=

=09
=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=
e=20
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=
=20
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=
=20
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20
Johnson, the safer choice. ""It was the smarter thing to do,"" he said.=20
=09
=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=
me as=20
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=
ll=20
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=

=09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is=

having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum=
s=20
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=
at=20
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20
=09 ?? A ""Major"" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=
=20
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20
=09
=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=
=20
allowed to =20
=09
=09compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet=
her=20
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20
=09
=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =
a=20
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=
=20
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=
7=20
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=

Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20
Simms can do.=20

=09
=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20
=09?? Sara McFadden=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=
is=20
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=
e=20
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20
=09
=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=
 It=20
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=
=20
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being ""the=
=20
man"" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=
=20
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=
=20
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20
=09
=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=
=20
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=
d=20
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=
h=20
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=
e=20
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=
 7=20
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in=
=20
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =
to=20
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20
=09
=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=
owed=20
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=
e=20
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=
ll=20
season long. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20

=20
simply being outplayed? =20
=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20

Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=
=20
schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20
=09
=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =
UT,=20
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=

nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20
=09
=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical ""scat-back=
,""=20
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=
=20

Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20

controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=

this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=
=20
=09

=09?? David Newburn=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=
 help=20
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=
=20
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=
s=20
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=
e=20
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I=
=20
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=
=20
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=
=20
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=
=20
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=
=20
Stanford).=20
=09
=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=

appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=
n=20
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=

The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=

have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but=
=20
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=
es=20
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20
=09
=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=
he=20
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=
=20
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=
=20
gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant=
=20
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20
=09
=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=
=20
Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your=
=20
All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't=
=20
they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20
=09?? Jeff Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return i=
n=20
front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I=
=20
would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he=

=20
hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time=

=09

Why One Firm Thinks excelr Is Running Out of Gas
By Peter Eavis 
Senior Columnist
Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com










A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling 
clients to quickly dump excelr (ENE:NYSE - news), believing that the energy 
trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's 
forecasts. 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks 
excelr's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of 
$1.79. The firm also believes excelr stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% 
below Wednesday's $59.20. 
The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights excelr's declining 
profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should 
trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS
:NYSE - news), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of excelr's 
33 times. OWS also alleges that excelr's earnings quality is poor and that key 
parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque. 
Houston-based excelr didn't comment by publication time on elements of the 
report that Detox sent the company. An energy analyst who is bullish on 
excelr's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings 
about the energy market and excelr's business model, but he says the report 
does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm 
doesn't give stock recommendations.) 
Economies of Scale
Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrill 
Lynch (MER:NYSE - news)? For one, OWS has an excellent track record. 
Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing 
down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve, recommending 
that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN:Nasdaq - news) in June 1999, 
when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their 
most insane. 




Pulling Back
excelr retreats after long rally


excelr, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual revenue of 
over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked 
alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks excelr is set for a 
precipitous drop nonetheless. Why? 
OWS's main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margins on 
excelr's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releases call 
IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are falling. Total 
IBIT of $795 million in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 
billion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth 
quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first quarter 
was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. 
This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an 
increasingly large share of excelr's revenue base. 
OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 excelr needs to generate an 
extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its 
2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79. 
The energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how excelr can 
continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply by 
increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words, 
margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings still go 
up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of 
the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percentage 
points. The analyst thinks excelr will make $1.82 per share in 2001. 
Growing On You
In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped excelr is 
likely to continue for several years, according to the analyst. He notes that 
roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. still isn't traded in a 
market. ""Eventually it will be part of a competitive environment, but it'll 
take five to 10 years,"" says the analyst. And he believes the extreme 
volatility in energy-related commodities that has also benefited excelr will 
exist for longer than OWS projects. 
Still, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. 
Return on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% 
in 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at 
Duke (DUK:NYSE - news) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news) (12.1%) and even 
Goldman (8.9%). 
Even excelr bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For 
example, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or 
trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the 
company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes excelr's 
related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities that 
have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities that 
excelr has traded with is headed by excelr's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The energy 
analyst comments: ""Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate."" 
The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has been 
a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber 
to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter 
of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical cable 
without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed excelr to beat 
analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather than 
missing by 2 cents. 
How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Street on excelr?

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

The $30,000 software credit will likely be used to purchase the web front end 
to the Livelink product.

Congratulations, Joel!

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet excelr requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=
o the=20
integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=
=20
OBSF functionality, the =01+bugs=01, have had an increasingly negative effe=
ct on=20
the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=
,=20
functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=
=20
July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=
as=20
also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20
experienced AS400 programmers to get upto speed on the system.

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20
AS400 system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays. The=

current situation has arisen due to non-delivery of IT developments and tig=

timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility.

Subject: Ski Trip


Hi Eric,
 
I know you must plan ahead for time off.  Perhaps this Dec. is not a good time for me to go.  I keep forgetting that it is sooner than I thought.  My foot will barely be healed by then so I doubt if I would ski.  I know, I don't ski that much anyway but I do like to venture out for 2 days.  I did find a good airfare from Continental, nonstop Houston to Denver at $262 if you and Shanna decide to go.   It requires travel on Tues. and/or Wed.  So, I was looking at Wed. to Tues.  A little longer than we normally stay.  Unfortunately, I saw no deals on the condos.  I really would like to do something for Dad's birthday - that's why I was thinking about Colo. because he loves it so much.  I am not totally ruling it out but I cannot commit at this time.  LU-M"

Subject: SAP and Seller Rules!!!! Please read

All,

July 1, SAP goes into effect for us here in Houston.  Also, the seller rules 
principle comes into play.  This means that if we (the IR/FX desk) owe you a 
payment in USD, GBP or EUR, you MUST book the payable in SAP to company 0967 
(we are no longer company 1Y3).  We then go into SAP and remove the block and 
that allows the payment to be sent.  

Per Corp., all intercompany trades are to be handled in this  manner.  This 
means that when you are paying us any of the 3 above currencies, we will go 
into SAP and book a payable to your company.  Going forward, when confirming 
settlements with Ana, you must be prepared to provide her with your company 
number.  You are then responsible for going into SAP and removing the block 
to allow payments to be released.  

Is SIFT UK interfacing directly to SAP, or will you manually be booking these 
entries?  If you are interfacing, the payable entry should automatically be 
created.  If you are  manually booking into SAP, you will need to coordinate 
with your accounting/reporting contacts to make sure that all of this goes 
smoothly.  If you are not the person who will be manually booking the entries 
into SAP, please forward this message to the appropriate person.

you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be

I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with
additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently
available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.

Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models
to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.
Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).

Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.

Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.

Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift 
earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like excelr Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'excelr Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.

Changes are required to the reporting format of excelr Europe's P/L in the 
Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'excelr 
Global Markets' heading to the 'excelr Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The excelr Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'excelr Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'excelr Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

Shona, Brent and Sally,
This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by 
Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296 
this morning.

Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk 
Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving 
global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into 
another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk 
Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its 
cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by 
being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from 
the ECT Group on Friday.

Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge excelr's cash flows when 
so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a 
good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily 
by 7:30 am.

Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for 
changes in book heirarchy.

Attached is the draft presentation of the internal controls component of the audit.  We are only planning on including the first 4 of 8 pages.   The last 4 pages were built anticipating Andersen being involved and are included here for reference only.

Page 4 is the RAC component.

I suggest that you, Ted, D Hardy and I visit by phone in the next couple of 
days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved.  
It would be useful for D Hardy and I to further describe some of the behind 
the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups (ie. 
RAC, Acctg, Logistics, Legal and Commercial) and the sequence and timing of 
those conversations.  I believe it will be most useful for you to have a 
better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed 
among senior management in the coming weeks.  I firmly believe that the 
Accounting/Commcl. Support and Logistics groups got much to close to 
commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues.  Some of our 
more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came 
from commercial support and logistics, not just commercial.  Given the nature 
of discussions around this issue, it is important that we have this 
conference call some time this week.  Let me know when you have some time or 
alternatively have Karen schedule with Sharon.

On a related note, at some point there was a struggle within Liquids 
concerning control over trading in the Helsinki office (between London and 
Ilkka).  Although the Helsinki office was originally intended only as a 
marketing office, in some respects it evolved into a stand-alone operation.  
I can not see where there was a conscious decision for it to be more than a 
marketing outpost and it would appear the decision concerning the amount of 
control enjoyed by Ilkka and his team came solely down to K Beasley.  I would 
like to discuss this in this call as well."

Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

Bob Huntley

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant
contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form
#OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to
close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.

To answer your question - bid cost guarantees should be entered by you, Larry 
or Narsimha as soon as you calculate them.  I will watch them periodically 
throughout the month to be sure you are calculating them correctly.  Any time

than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the 
Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited 
to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and 
maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural 
gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the 
Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes:

 Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. 

 Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance.

This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the 
last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the 
TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation 
of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 
mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor 
station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns.

It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the 
TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been 
adopted by excelr's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and 
report as appropriate.

The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows:

 Midland (915)  570-4795    Included facilities-  Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, 
Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole

 Lubbock (806)  796-7107  Included facilities-  P-2, Plainview, Brownfield

 San Angelo (915)  658-5431  Included facilities- Reagan Co. 2, Irion Co. 1, 
Eldorado

Reporting forms for the release can be faxed to your location by request by 
contacting me at (505) 625-8022.

Sally,

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about 
getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources?  
Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those 
resources on GCP?

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Please help!!!

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.

tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year 
when i first started.  he had been dating his fiancee during college but they 
had broken up about a year ago.  he had been trying to get back together but 
i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.  i guess he 
had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went 
well over christmas he went ahead.

have a fun and safe weekend.

Hi E,

Glad to hear all is well with the exception of Toni, of course.  I am sorry
to hear of her unending heartache.  Tell Shanna I'm thinking of all of them.
Is her mother going to be there?

Which one is Tim?  Did you know he was getting engaged?

Have a good weekend.  Everything is good here.  We're going out tonight and
will meet Ken and Cheryl for dinner tomorrow night.

Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to
Happy Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit
Toni tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than
that, just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that

How are things on the homefront?

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the excelr Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

--
Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from 
legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some 
response.  Better if it coincides with excelr's view and is not anti-market.  
We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be 
included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.  

Phillip

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to excelr; it drives our success and wil=

seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20

=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of excelr and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some excelr companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
excelr Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.excelr.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
